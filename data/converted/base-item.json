While it's difficult for those in Avistan to get their hands on these Hongali weapons, a small warband of beast-riding orcs from the Hold of Belkzen managed to arm themselves with Hongali hornbows and cut a bloody swathe through adventurers and neighboring militaries alike for several years before they were finally defeated via a desperate ambush.
