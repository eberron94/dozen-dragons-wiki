For example, if a spy wants to infiltrate a military camp, they must be wearing the same type of armor as the soldiers stationed there—or else have a very good explanation for their commander as to why they're out of proper uniform!

When these shaped plates are arranged and connected, they can be made to look like almost any basic suit of light or medium metal armor, though armor embellishments such as those worn by highranking officers are beyond this device. The arrangement process takes some time, but once it's completed, the user need only perform a few simple adjustments to a clockwork mechanism in the disguise to make the plate arrangement into a new preset configuration. Afterwards, when the user flips a switch on the harness's belt to one of three positions, the plates shift, overlap, and connect as necessary to transform the disguise into the desired preset configuration.

While it's difficult for those in Avistan to get their hands on these Hongali weapons, a small warband of beast-riding orcs from the Hold of Belkzen managed to arm themselves with Hongali hornbows and cut a bloody swathe through adventurers and neighboring militaries alike for several years before they were finally defeated via a desperate ambush. The stories of that warband spread, causing Avistani adventurers with little knowledge of Tian Xia to associate the bows with orcs. Hongali characters have access to the Hongali hornbow."

The flint and steel can be used up to 10 times before needing to be replaced. Though inspired by advanced Numerian technology, the polytool is a simple enough feat of metalworking that any blacksmith could produce it—perfect for the goddess Casandalee to spread innovation farther than actual Numerian tech could reach."
