While it's more humane to use this strategy with mindless constructs or undead, occasionally an exceedingly foolhardy adventurer demands the opportunity to try it. Loading a creature requires two additional Load actions, which you must conduct personally. The creature must be willing, unconscious, or restrained throughout the process, and the siege weapon must be physically capable of firing the creature in question, based on their size and shape. Typically, that means ballistas don't qualify, for example—nor do auto-catapults which require specifically-sized balls—but normal catapults and onagers work just fine. When you Launch the weapon, if the weapon usually targets an area, you target a single 5-foot square instead. The siege weapon deals its normal damage to its target, or to the modified area, and to the creature fired."

Your mind weapon is an extension of your mind—it has no Hardness, and any ability that would damage your mind weapon instead damages you directly, pushing back against the weapon's corporeal form and becoming mental damage of the same amount the weapon would have taken. You can project your mind weapon using an Interact action, just as you would draw any other weapon. Only you can hold, carry, or wield your mind weapon; if held by another person, it quickly disappears from their hand, reforming in your mind for you to project again. If you're disarmed of your mind weapon, it dematerializes, but you can draw it again with an Interact action starting at the beginning of your next turn. Upon creating your mind weapon, you also learn to use a mind smith's keepsake: an object of light Bulk, such as a bracelet or figurine, that you wear or keep on your person and inscribe with weapon runes. Your keepsake can't be a magic item, nor can it have any significant monetary value beyond the value of any runes you inscribe on it. You can buy and inscribe fundamental runes and weapon property runes onto your keepsake in the same way you would for a regular weapon, and you can move runes to and from your keepsake to other weapons or runestones for the usual cost. Any runes inscribed on the keepsake apply to your mind weapon when you create it. If your keepsake is ever lost or destroyed, you can spend 1 week of downtime imprinting a new object with your weapon's mental properties, though this new keepsake won't have any of the runes that were inscribed on the prior keepsake."
