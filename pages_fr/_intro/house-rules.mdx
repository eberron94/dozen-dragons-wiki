Some house rules for this campaign.

# Automatic Lore

Any lore you gain from your background, culture, or an ancestry Lore feats, like {{{ref "Dragonborn Lore"}}}, increase in proficiency as you level up. At 3rd, 7th, and 15th level, any relevant lore increases its proficiency to expert, master, and legendary respectively.

# Ancestry Paragon

**Optional Rule** [Ancestry Paragon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1336)

At 1st level, you gain two ancestry feats. At every odd level thereafter, you gain another ancestry feats. This is instead of the normal ancestry feat you gain at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th.

# Automatic Bonus Progression (modified)

**Optional Rule** [Automatic Bonus Progression](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1357)

Magic items that grant a bonus to attack, AC, saves, weapon damage dice, and perception do not exist. Instead, you gain the following class features that grant potency bonus.

There are two changes from the standard ABP. You do not gain skill potency or the ability apex. You must purchase or find magic items for that still. The primary reasoning for this is Foundry VTT does not automatically handle ABP for skills and apex.

## Attack Potency

Starting at 2nd level, you gain a +1 potency bonus to attack rolls with all weapons and unarmed attacks. This increases to +2 at 10th level, and +3 at 16th level.

## Devastating Attacks

At 4th level, your weapon and unarmed Strikes deal two damage dice instead of one. This increases to three at 12th level and to four at 19th level.

## Defense Potency

At 5th level, you gain a +1 potency bonus to AC. At 11th level, this bonus increases to +2, and at 18th level, to +3.

## Perception Potency

At 7th level, you gain a +1 potency bonus to Perception, increasing to +2 at level 13 and +3 at level 19.

## Saving Throw Potency

At 8th level, you gain a +1 potency bonus to saves, increasing to +2 at level 14 and +3 at level 20.

# Free Archetype

**Optional Rule** [Free Archetype](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1333)

At 2nd level and every even level thereafter, you gain an extra class feat that can only be used for an archetype dedication or an archetype feat. Only archetypes on the approved list can be used for this extra feat. Any ancestry feat that grants you an archetype dedication adds that archetype to the list.

Your normal class feats can still be used to take archetype feats for any archetype, including ones on this list.
