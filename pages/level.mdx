# Potent Skills

At certain levels, you gain a potency bonus to all skills and abilities you are proficient with. At 4th-level, you gain a +1 potency bonus. This increases to +2 at 10th-level and to +3 at 16th level. Any references to item bonus in the rule text is ignored, except for certain alchemical items. See the house rules page for additional details.

# Skill Increase

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained (+2) in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert (+4).

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master (+6) in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary (+8) in a skill in which you're already a master.

# Ability Boost

At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you boost one ability score. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.

Starting at 5th level, you can use ability boosts to increase an ability from 19 to 20. At 10th level, you can boost an ability from 20 to 21. At 15th level, you can boost an ability from 21 to 22.

# Potent Skills & Devastating Weapons

The skills and abilities you have mastered are more potent from your adventures. At 4th level, you gain a +1-potency bonus. This increases to +2 at 10th level and to +3 at 16th level. Any references to item bonus in the rule text is ignored, except for certain alchemical items.

Additionally, your weapon blows deal incredible damage. At 4th level, your weapon and unarmed Strikes deal two damage dice instead of one. This increases to three at 12th level and to four at 19th level.

See house rules for more information on these bonuses.
