Some house rules for this campaign.

# Proficiency without Level

Normally, when you are proficient with a skill or ability, you add your level to it. For this campaign, we will be using the Proficiency without Level variant rule. Most of this wiki is edited to reflect this rule.

The following cases are not covered by the Rules as Written and so are adjudicated below.

Items that make references to a specific DC to be used for skill checks or saving throws are modified by their relevant level. For example, Blightburn Resin is a 11th-level poison with a DC 31 Fortitude Check. Under this rule, it becomes a DC 20 (DC 31 - 11 levels).

Actions like the Medicine's Treat Wounds action, that list a DC which is gated by character proficiency, will be reduced by your level. For example, a level 4 character attempts an expert Treat Wounds action, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check. Under this rule, the Medicine check becomes DC 16 (DC 20 - 4 levels).

Actions like the Inventor's Overdrive class feature, that dynamically determined DC by character level, will use the adjusted DC chart. This chart is simply the RAW DC chart with the level subtracted from the DC.

All flat DC checks are unchanged, no matter their source.

# Potent Skills

Normally, you gain item bonus to skills, abilities, and saving throws from magical items. For this campaign, we will be using a modified version of Automatic Bonus Progression.

At 4th level, all skills, abilities, and saving throws that you are proficient with (meaning trained, expert, master, or legendary) gain a +1 potency bonus. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level, and +3 at 16th level. This specifically does not increase Class DC or Spellcasting DC.

Item bonuses do not exist, there are a few expectations and specific alterations to items and spells.

-   Armor, which grants an item bonus to AC, is unchanged since it is a basic part of the system
-   The spell Magic Weapon now grants a +1 status bonus to attack rolls made with the weapon
-   Alchemical bombs and elixirs that have an item bonus of +1 or greater now grant a +1 status bonus to attack rolls made with them

Any case not covered by the above cases will be handled by comparing the spirit of the item bonus against the house rule and its cases.

# Devastating Weapons

The other half of Automatic Bonus Progression variant rule is weapon damage increases with level. That is maintained. At 4th level, your weapon and unarmed Strikes deal two damage dice instead of one. This increases to three at 12th level and to four at 19th level.

# Paragon Feats

This is a modified version of the Free Archetype and Paragon Ancestry variant rules.

At 1st level, and every odd level after that, you gain an additional feat that can either be an ancestry feat, skill feat, or a feat from one of the archetypes listed below. Additionally, 2nd level archetype dedication feats can be taken at 1st level.

## Free Archetypes

The list of archetypes you can take with Paragon Feats. This does not prevent you from taking archetype feats with your normal class feats.
