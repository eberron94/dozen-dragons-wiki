Some house rules for this campaign.

# Proficiency without Level

Normally, when you are proficient with a skill or ability, you add your level to it. For this campaign, we will be using the Proficiency without Level variant rule. Most of this wiki is edited to reflect this rule. The following cases are not covered by the Rules as Written and so are adjudicated below.

Items that make references to a specific DC to be used for skill checks or saving throws are modified by their relevant level. For example, Blightburn Resin is a 11th-level poison with a DC 31 Fortitude Check. Under this rule, it becomes a DC 20 (DC 31 - 11 levels).

Actions like {{{ref "Treat Wounds"}}}, which list a DC that is gated by character proficiency, will be reduced by your level. For example, a level 4 character attempting an expert Treat Wounds action, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check, would instead make a DC 16 check (DC 20 - 4 levels).

{{{ref "Aid"}}} has its typical DC updated to DC of 10. This will allow a more consistent success rate at early levels while still maintaining some consistency at later levels.

Actions like the Inventor's Overdrive class feature, that dynamically determined DC by character level, will use the adjusted DC chart. This chart is simply the RAW DC chart with the level subtracted from the DC.

All flat DC checks are unchanged, no matter their source.

# Potent Skills

Normally you gain an item bonus to saving throws, skills, perception, weapon strikes, and AC from magical items. For this campaign, we will be using a modified version of the Automatic Bonus Progression variant rule.

At 4th level, perception and all saving throws, skills, weapon strikes, and AC that you are proficient in (meaning trained, expert, master, or legendary) gain a +1 potency bonus. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level, and +3 at 16th level. This modifies the final value, so you can edit your character sheet as such. This specifically does not increase class DC, spellcasting DC, or spellcasting strikes.

Item bonus are removed from the game for all items except basic armor. The following changes are made to specific spells and items.

-   {{{ref "Magic Weapon"}}} gives the target weapon the magical trait and a +1 status bonus to damage per weapon die.
-   Alchemical bombs that grant an item bonus to Strikes made with them instead give a +1 status bonus to Strikes.
-   Mutagens that grant an item bonus to a rolled or opposed stat instead give a static +1 status bonus to the same stat.
- Certain elixirs, like {{{ref "Antidote"}}}, grant a status bonus equal to the original item bonus. This is purely case-by-case.

Any case not covered by the above cases will be handled by comparing the spirit of the item bonus against the house rule and its cases. In general, the wiki should have all entries reflect these rules. If you see something out of place, ask the GM.

# Devastating Weapons

The other half of the Automatic Bonus Progression variant rule is weapon damage increasing with level. That is maintained. At 4th level, your weapon and unarmed Strikes deal two damage dice instead of one. This increases to three at 12th level and to four at 19th level.

# Automatic Lore

Any lore you gain from your background and culture and from the ancestry Lore feats, like {{{ref "Dragonborn Lore"}}}, increase in proficiency as you level up. At 3rd, 7th, and 15th level, any relevant lore increases its proficiency to expert, master, and legendary respectively.

# Paragon Feats

At 1st level, and every odd level after that, you gain an additional feat that can either be an ancestry feat, skill feat, or a feat from one of the archetypes listed below. Additionally, 2nd level archetype dedication feats can be taken at 1st level.

This is a modified version of the Free Archetype and Paragon Ancestry variant rules.

## Free Archetypes

The list of archetypes you can take with Paragon Feats. This does not prevent you from taking archetype feats with your normal class feats. The pages of each archetype will also state if it is a free archetype.
