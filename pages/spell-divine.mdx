Divine Magic is a type of spellcasting that draws on the power of divine beings, such as gods, angels, and other entities. These spellcasters use their faith to access the power of these powerful beings and create powerful effects. Spells from the divine tradition draw on the power of these divine beings, allowing spellcasters to heal wounds, protect allies, and even smite their foes.
