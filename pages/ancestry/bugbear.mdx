Bugbears, for many, are monsters belonging to storybooks and nightmares. Stories speak of bugbears as great hairy beasts that lurk in the shadows --- it is the bugbears that lie in the darkness undetected, waiting for the children that strayed off the beaten path or too far from their parents, or for the villagers wandering out at night away from their homes. They drag the foolish and unsuspecting to their den to be devoured alive; worse, if they cut off your head, your soul is bound to Eberron and can never reach Dolurrh.

These terrible and fearsome stories flowered from small seeds of truth. Most bugbears, despite their size, rely on stealth and the cover of night to surprise their enemies --- expending great bursts of energy to end fights before the victim can react. However, bugbears themselves are no more likely to eat other humanoids than humans themselves. The true bugbears of the forest, unlike those expected from human folklore, tend towards peace and the flow of nature rather than violence. After the Last War, many more stories of stoic bugbear rangers or druids guiding lost troops to safety through impossible terrain have been retold by soldiers.

Alongside this, new stories of bugbears are being forged by Darguun, a nation that rose from the ashes of the Last War. There are also many stories yet untold of the militant bugbears belonging to the secretive Dhakaani Empire.

# Heritages

You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

### Appearance

Bugbears outsize most humanoids that they meet. Bugbears are typically extremely muscular, able to lift and move great weights with their long limbs. They are covered in thick short fur and share the same pointed ears as their goblinoid cousins. Due to their longer limbs, weapons wielded in the hands of bugbears have a greater reach than typical. They take their name from their noses and claws, which are similar to those of bears.
