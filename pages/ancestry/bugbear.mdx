A bugbear is a massive humanoid distantly related to, but larger and stronger than, goblins and hobgoblins. They are one of the only goblinoids to be covered in fur. Like the other goblinoids in Eberron, bugbears were once part of the dominant civilization of Khorvaire thousands of years ago

# Heritages

You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

## Khesh Guul'dar

Your stealth is uncanny, your step light, and your muddy yellow fur seems to blend with the natural world more than most bugbears. You are trained in Stealth (or another skill if you were already trained in Stealth). In addition, you gain the {{{ref "Terrain Stalker"}}} feat.

### Appearance

Bugbears resemble hairy, feral goblins standing 7 feet tall. They take their name from their noses and claws, which are similar to those of bears.
