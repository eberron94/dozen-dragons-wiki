Warforged as a race are older than Khorvaire knows. Automatons are usually from Xen'drik and found in stasis.

**Artificial Body** You are alive, but your physiological needs are different than those of living creatures. You don't need to eat or drink. You don't need to sleep, but you still need a daily period of rest. During this period of rest, you must enter a recuperating standby state for 2 hours, which is similar to sleeping except you are aware of your surroundings and don't take penalties for being unconscious. Much like with sleeping, if you go too long without entering your standby state, you become fatigued and can't recover until you enter standby for 2 hours.

**Composite Frame** The plating used to protect your wooden skeleton is a special type of armor, designed to be integrated directly with a warforged's frame. You can only wear armor with the Component trait, this prevents you from wearing traditional armor. This armor is not natural armor so runes can be engraved on it. While you live, the armor incorporated into your body can't be removed against your will. If you are forced into a suit of armor, you do not benefit from the AC Bonus but the Dex Cap, Check Penalty, and Speed Penalty are still applied.

**Living Construct** You don't have the typical construct immunities, can be affected by effects that target a living creature, and can recover Hit Points normally via positive energy. Additionally, you are not destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. Instead, your life energy attempts to keep you active even in dire straits; you are knocked out and begin dying when reduced to 0 Hit Points. When a creature would attempt a Treat Wounds action on you, they must attempt a Craft check instead of a Medicine check, and must use their Craft skill proficiency to determine the check DC and amount of Hit Points healed.

# Heritages

You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

## Hunter

You were designed to serve as a scout or assassin and have a body resembling a pack hunter like a large cat or wolf. Though you typically move like a quadruped, you can still stand and fight like a biped, allowing you to use all equipment normally. Your quadruped design allows you to move quickly; if you have both hands free, you can increase your Speed to 30 feet as you run on all fours.

## Mage

The chamber housing your core has a more direct connection to the rest of your humanoid shape, allowing you to tap into your core's magical energy. You gain one cantrip from the arcane spell list. You can cast this spell as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.

## Sharpshooter

Your lithe, humanoid shape is designed for speed and accuracy suitable for ranged combat. You gain the Automaton Aim action.

## Warrior

Sporting a bulkier, powerful design, your body has been designed for combat. You have a bulky, humanoid shape. The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4. You don't take a penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attack.

### Appearance

The warforged are made of stone, metal, and wood fibers. The core of a warforged is a skeletal frame made of metal and stone with wood fibers acting as a muscular system. Covering the warforged is an outer shell of metal and stone plates. An internal network of tubes run through the warforged's body; these tubes are filled with an alchemical blood-like fluid that is designed to lubricate and nourish their systems. Their hands have only two thick fingers and a thumb, whilst their feet only have two broad toes. Their body is sexless.
