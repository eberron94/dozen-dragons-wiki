# Heritages

You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

## Draxie

You are kin to faerie dragons, tracing your heritage back to the death of the mightiest faerie dragon in the First World. You gain touch telepathy, allowing you to communicate silently and purely mentally with any creature you're touching, as long as you share a language.

## Grig

You have the hindquarters of a cricket and adore art and music. Your cricket legs grant you a +2 circumstance bonus on Athletics checks to High Jump or Long Jump, and you gain ghost sound as a primal innate cantrip.

## Luminous Sprite

You glow with magical luminance. You naturally shed light as a torch; this light has the evocation, light, and primal traits. You can extinguish, rekindle, or change the color of this light using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.

## Melixie

You have the features of a bee, butterfly, or other insect that loves sweets. You can ask questions of and receive answers from arthropods (insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, and similar invertebrate animals), as well as use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on and Request things of them. Most bees, butterflies, moths, and beetles have an indifferent or friendly starting attitude toward you and give you time to make your case, though other arthropods react to you like any other adventurer.

## Nyktera

You have batlike features, an affinity for batkind, and hearing that is second to none. As long as you can hear normally, you can use the Seek action to sense undetected creatures in a 60-foot cone instead of a 30-foot cone. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to locate undetected creatures that you could hear within 30 feet with a Seek action.

## Pixie

You are larger than other sprites. Instead of Tiny, your size is Small.
