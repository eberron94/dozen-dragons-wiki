Sprites are diminutive, whimsical, and exuberant creatures from the plane of Thelanis, also known as The Faerie Court. They love playing pranks, exploring new things, and embracing everything to do with magic.

# Mechanics

**Hit Points** 6

**Size** Tiny

**Speed** 20 feet; **Fly** 10 feet

**Senses** low-light vision

**Ability Boots**

-   Dexterity
-   Intelligence
-   Free

**Ability Flaw**

-   Strength

**Magical Strikes** Your inherent magic pervades your entire being. All your Strikes are magical, whether with unarmed attacks or weapons.

**Magician's Dust** By spending 10 minutes with a piece of adventuring equipment meant for small or medium sized creatures, you reduce its size to allow you to comfortably use it. While reduced, the item gains the magical trait. As a free action, you can return the item to its original size.

This magic is governed by the rules of Thelanis, making it anathema to you to attempt to keep an item reduced that you do not own or manipulate the concept of ownership. An item that has left your possession for a significant time or you have given away or lost must have its size returned.

> **Tiny PCs** PCs are typically Small or Medium size, but most sprite PCs are Tiny instead! Being Tiny comes with its own set of rules about space and reach. Your Tiny sprite can enter another creature's space, which is important because your melee Strikes typically have no reach, meaning you must enter their space to attack them. Like other Tiny creatures, you don't automatically receive lesser cover from being in a larger creature's space, but circumstances might allow you to Take Cover. You can purchase weapons, armor, and other items for your size with the same statistics as normal gear, except that melee weapons have a reach of 0 for you (or a reach 5 feet shorter than normal if they have the reach trait). Remember to adjust the Bulk of items and your Bulk limit for Tiny size.  
> **Riding PCs** As a Tiny creature, a sprite PC weighs so little and takes up so little Bulk that it doesn't cause issues to hitch a ride in a sack, shoulder, or other position on another PC. However, the amount of coordination required to ensure you don't get in each other's way or jostle each other into losing actions makes this tactic unfavorable for most fellow adventurers during combat. If you're riding along with another PC or similar non-minion intelligent creature, roll both your initiatives and use the lower of the two results. You act in either order on the same initiative count. While traveling in this way, you each gain two actions at the start of your turn, instead of three, since they spend one action keeping you balanced on their back, and you spend one action maintaining your grip.

# Heritages

You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

## Draxie

You are kin to faerie dragons, tracing your heritage back to the death of the mightiest faerie dragon in the First World. You gain touch telepathy, allowing you to communicate silently and purely mentally with any creature you're touching, as long as you share a language.

## Grig

You have the hindquarters of a cricket and adore art and music. Your cricket legs grant you a +2 circumstance bonus on Athletics checks to High Jump or Long Jump, and you gain ghost sound as a primal innate cantrip.

## Luminous Sprite

You glow with magical luminance. You naturally shed light as a torch; this light has the evocation, light, and primal traits. You can extinguish, rekindle, or change the color of this light using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.

## Melixie

You have the features of a bee, butterfly, or other insect that loves sweets. You can ask questions of and receive answers from arthropods (insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, and similar invertebrate animals), as well as use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on and Request things of them. Most bees, butterflies, moths, and beetles have an indifferent or friendly starting attitude toward you and give you time to make your case, though other arthropods react to you like any other adventurer.

## Nyktera

You have batlike features, an affinity for batkind, and hearing that is second to none. As long as you can hear normally, you can use the Seek action to sense undetected creatures in a 60-foot cone instead of a 30-foot cone. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to locate undetected creatures that you could hear within 30 feet with a Seek action.

## Pixie

You are larger than other sprites. Instead of Tiny, your size is Small.

### Appearance

Sprites are tiny faeries whose features vary wildly based on their heritage. The Wingless—those with the potential to become powerful heroes and villains—slowly grow their wings over time as their magical potential manifests, though some never grow wings at all. Those sprites with humbler destinies typically grow wings when reaching full adulthood and mastering their innate magic.

### Names

Sprite names are based entirely on their story within Thelanis.
