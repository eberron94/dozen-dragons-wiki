Curious and gregarious wanderers, catfolk combine features of felines and humanoids in both appearance and temperament. They enjoy learning new things, collecting new tales and trinkets, and ensuring their loved ones are safe and happy. Catfolk view themselves as chosen guardians of natural places in the world and are often recklessly brave, even in the face of overwhelming opposition.

In Eberron, the catfolk can be found in the Lhazaar Principalities or Xen'drik. While many see them as shifters, they are in fact a distinct race. Those found in the Lhazaar Principalities are either traders or pirates, while the ones in Xen'Drik live nocturnally in the desert on the north-west part of the continent or in the jungle.

# Heritages

You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

## Clawed Catfolk

Your family has particularly long, sharp claws capable of delivering bleeding wounds with a wicked swipe. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d6 slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group and have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.

## Flexible Catfolk

You've inherited flexibility beyond that of most humanoids. You don't treat tight spaces that don't require you to Squeeze as difficult terrain. In addition, you get a +1 circumstance bonus to checks when you attempt to Escape.

## Hunting Catfolk

You come from a long line of skilled hunters and trackers and have a particularly keen sense of smell. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine a creature's location. The GM will usually double the range if you're downwind from the creature or halve the range if you're upwind.

In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Track a creature or object if you've smelled it before.

## Jungle Catfolk

You're descended from jungle stalkers and can move swiftly through scrub and underbrush. You ignore difficult terrain from undergrowth, and greater difficult terrain from undergrowth is only difficult terrain for you.

## Liminal Catfolk

You've inherited a closeness to the far corners of the world, where the boundaries between dimensions grow thin. You can cast detect magic as an occult innate cantrip heightened to half your level, rounded up. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Occultism checks to Recall Knowledge about creatures that originated outside of the Material Plane.

## Nine Lives Catfolk

Your family has always seemed to bounce back from disaster, not through physical hardiness or specialized skill, but from sheer luck. Other catfolk whisper that you have nine lives. If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points by a critical hit on an attack roll, you become dying 1 instead of dying 2.

## Sharp-Eared Catfolk

You were born with big, expressive ears that move with your moods and perk up at any unexpected sound. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to locate undetected creatures that you could hear within 30 feet with a Seek action. As long as you're aware of a creature via sound, once per round, your ears can help you Point Out the creature to all allies as a free action.

## Desert Catfolk^â€ ^

You have a thick coat of fur that protects you from the cold. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
