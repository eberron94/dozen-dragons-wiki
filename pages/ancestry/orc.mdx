# Heritages

You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

## Badlands Orc

You come from sun-scorched badlands, where long legs and an ability to withstand the elements helped you thrive. You can Hustle twice as long while exploring before you have to stop, and you treat environmental heat effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible heat becomes extreme, extreme heat becomes severe, and so on).

## Battle-Ready Orc

You descend from a line of terrifying battlefield commanders. You become trained in Intimidation, and you gain the Intimidating Glare skill feat.

## Deep Orc

Your calloused hands and red eyes speak to a life spent in the deep darkness of mountain caverns, where you learned to battle on rocky cliffs and survive with minimal resources. You gain the Terrain Expertise skill feat for underground terrain and the Combat Climber skill feat.

## Grave Orc

You were exposed to powerful necromantic energies that should have killed you---but you survived. Your skin is cold, clammy, and gray. You gain resistance to negative damage equal to half your level (minimum 1). You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against necromancy effects.

## Hold-Scarred Orc

You are part of an orc community that participates in ritual tattooing. The marks on your skin show your exceptional hardiness and vitality. You gain 12 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 10. You also gain the Diehard feat.

## Rainfall Orc

You were born in a flooded forest with only tangles of trees providing protection from torrential rainstorms and flash floods. You've learned to move adeptly through jungle terrain and resist the various ailments common in humid environs. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Climb or Swim and a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases.

## Winter Orc

Your ancestors survived in cold climates. You become trained in Survival, and you treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).

### Appearance

Orcs are tall and powerfully built, with long arms and stocky legs. Many orcs top 7 feet in height, though they tend to adopt broad, almost bow-legged stances and slouch forward at the shoulders. The combination makes for a seeming contradiction, sharing an eye level with most humanoids while simultaneously towering over them. Orcs have rough skin, thick bones, and rockhard muscles, making them suited to war and other physically demanding tasks. Despite the roughness of their skin, orcs scar easily, and most orcs take great pride in the scars they have accumulated. Orc skin color is typically green and occasionally gray, though some orcs have other skin colors that reflect adaptations to their environments.

### Names

Lizardfolk names come from their ancient language and tend to be traditional. Names are typically chosen by the clan's astrologer in accordance to omens and which star signs are ascendant when an egg hatches, though occasionally the parents may name a hatchling for an ancestor or a beloved historical hero.

**Example Names** Arasheg, Barashk, Essaru, Enshuk, Gishkim, Hazi, Inishish, Kutak, Nasha, Shulkuru, Tizkar, Utakish, Zelkekek
