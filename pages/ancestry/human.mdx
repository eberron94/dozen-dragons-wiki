Humans have inhabited Khorvaire for millennia. They dominate the land, but in some ways they are relative newcomers to the continent. Most humans don't spend time contemplating their race's origins, and many do not even know that they are not native to Khorvaire.

Humans have an abnormally large number of bloodlines that can manifest a dragonmark: Mark of Finding, Mark of Handling, Mark of Making, Mark of Passage, and Mark of Sentinel. Each dragonmark bloodline has unique powers and are part of one of the human run Dragonmark Houses.

# Heritages

You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

## Skilled

Your ingenuity allows you to train in a wide variety of skills. You become trained in one skill of your choice. At 5th level, you become an expert in the chosen skill.

## Versatile Heritage

Humanity's versatility and ambition have fueled its ascendance to be the most common ancestry in most nations throughout the world. Select a general feat of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites (as with your ancestry feat, you can select this general feat at any point during character creation).
