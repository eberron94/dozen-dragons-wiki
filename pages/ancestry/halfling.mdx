In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. The heritage of the nomad also serves more urbanized halflings well, and halflings have established themselves across Khorvaire as merchants, politicians, barristers, healers, and criminals. The tribal nomads of the plains can sometimes be found in the cities, but often the halflings of the cities blend in with the rest of the population and display only the occasional reminder of their nomadic roots.

Halflings can manifest the Mark of Healing, granting those who bear it with magic that can cure and aid those in need, or the Mark of Hospitality, bestowing powers related to both food and shelter. The Mark of Healing bloodlines are part of House Ghallanda, while the Mark of Hospitality halflings are part of House Jorasco.
