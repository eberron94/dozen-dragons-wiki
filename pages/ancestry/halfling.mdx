In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. The heritage of the nomad also serves more urbanized halflings well, and halflings have established themselves across Khorvaire as merchants, politicians, barristers, healers, and criminals. The tribal nomads of the plains can sometimes be found in the cities, but often the halflings of the cities blend in with the rest of the population and display only the occasional reminder of their nomadic roots.

Halflings can manifest the Mark of Healing, granting those who bear it with magic that can cure and aid those in need, or the Mark of Hospitality, bestowing powers related to both food and shelter. The Mark of Healing bloodlines are part of House Ghallanda, while the Mark of Hospitality halflings are part of House Jorasco.

### Appearance

Halflings are short humanoids who look vaguely like smaller humans. They rarely grow to be more than 3 feet in height. Halfling proportions vary, with some looking like shorter adult humans with slightly larger heads and others having proportions closer to those of a human child.

Most halflings prefer to walk barefoot rather than wearing shoes, and those who do so develop roughly calloused soles on their feet over time. Tufts of thick, often-curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. Halfling skin tones tend toward rich, tawny shades like amber or oak, and their hair color ranges from a light golden blond to raven black.

### Names

Halfling names are usually two to three syllables, with a gentle sound that avoids hard consonants. Preferring their names to sound humble, halflings see overly long or complex names as a sign of arrogance. This goes only for their own people, howeverâ€”halflings have names that suit them, and they understand that elves and humans might have longer names to suit their own aesthetics.
