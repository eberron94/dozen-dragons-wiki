Shifters, sometimes called "the weretouched," are descended from humans and natural lycanthropes, now nearly extinct on Khorvaire. Shifters cannot fully change shape but can take on animalistic features---a state they call shifting. Shifters have evolved into a unique race that breeds true. They have a distinct culture with its own traditions and identity.

### Appearance

Shifters are an unusual regression of the typical lycanthrope that has changed into a completely separate species, capable of reproduction but not infection. As a humanoid race, shifters are typically somewhat shorter and stockier than humans, commonly with tan or brown skin, pronounced fingernails, toenails, eyebrows, flat noses and wide set eyes. As a clear indication of their lycanthrope heritage, shifters of both genders usually have an abundance of body hair, much more than that of what is typical for a humanoid. While this is distinctly not fur, it does tend to grow thick and course from the head down to the middle of the back, along both forearms and also on the shins and tops of the feet. It ranges in a variety of hues ranging from deep black, grey, tan, brown, orange, red and white, while shifter eye color has been known to be green, yellow, brown, blue or black. Those descended from lycanthropes other than mammals, like weresharks, would look more like the animal of their ancestors, like being bald with rough skin.

### Names

Shifters often take names that are simple and common in the nearby communities, often copying human names without titles or lineages to best go unnoticed.
