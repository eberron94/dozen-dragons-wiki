Khoravar, also known as the half-elves, share the continent of Khorvaire with the other common races. When the elves first came to the continent and began mingling with the human settlers, the first half-elves were born. Over time, the half-elves gathered and formed two distinct family groups---the groups that eventually became House Lyrandar and House Medani. For two thousand years, the half-elves of Khorvaire have possessed a culture and society of their own. They came to be known as the khoravar, meaning the children of Khorvaire. Occasionally, elves and humans still produce half-elves, but those belonging to the two khoravar dragonmarked houses breed true as a race of their own.

Khoravar can manifest the Mark of Detection, granting powers of detection and the ability to ferret out danger whether from an ambush or a cup of poisoned wine, and the Mark of Storm, which bestows powers over the weather, from calm winds to raging rainstorms. The Mark of Detection bloodlines are part of House Medani, while the Mark of Storm khoravar are part of House Lyrandar.
