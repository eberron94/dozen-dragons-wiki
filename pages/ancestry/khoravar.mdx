Khoravar, also known as the half-elves, share the continent of Khorvaire with the other common races. When the elves first came to the continent and began mingling with the human settlers, the first half-elves were born. Over time, the half-elves gathered and formed two distinct family groups---the groups that eventually became House Lyrandar and House Medani. For two thousand years, the half-elves of Khorvaire have possessed a culture and society of their own. They came to be known as the khoravar, meaning the children of Khorvaire. Occasionally, elves and humans still produce half-elves, but those belonging to the two khoravar dragonmarked houses breed true as a race of their own.

Khoravar can manifest the Mark of Detection, granting powers of detection and the ability to ferret out danger whether from an ambush or a cup of poisoned wine, and the Mark of Storm, which bestows powers over the weather, from calm winds to raging rainstorms. The Mark of Detection bloodlines are part of House Medani, while the Mark of Storm khoravar are part of House Lyrandar.

### Appearance

While half-elves retain the pointed ears of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Their eyes tend to be human-like in shape, but feature an exotic range of colors from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue.

### Names

Usually have fairly common or short first names, and often bear a last name from their family among either the Khorovar Riverclans, or the Lhaazar Waveclans. The family names of the Clans differ by region. The Riverclans typically bear family names that somehow involve the water, boats, and sometimes plays on words. The Waveclan names are often more dynamic and taken from the sea. Only a handful of the Clans take names after predators though, as they feel it is bad luck and reflects poorly on a person. The most famous of the predatory family names are the Whitefins and the Threshers from Lhaazar, the Pykes from around Scion's Sound, and the Gar from southern Khorvaire. The Pykes were supposedly driven to give up their pirating ways centuries ago by the northern satrapies of Galifar but were allowed to keep their names. The Gar were driven nearly to extinction by Malleon the Reaver and subsequent human incursions into southern Khorvaire. They are rarely found now. The Thresher and Whitefin Waveclans were humbled with the rise of the Pirate Princes, but kept to themselves and adapted as all good predators do living on the outskirts of the Lhaazar Principalities, preying on any who aren't watchful.

Those that grow up among humans often take after their human relatives in naming themselves. Very few half-elves grow up among the elves and are usually relegated as second or even third class citizens. They aren't allowed to take family names there and are usually identified by the town from which they hail.
