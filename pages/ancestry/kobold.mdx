Outsiders often assume that kobolds are primitive and savage since they live in unmodified caverns and rely on oral tradition instead of written records. Also, they live in small tribal communities and have never come together to create cities, nations, or empires. However, kobolds are just as sophisticated as humans or gnomes. While they prefer to live in natural environments instead of creating artificial structures, kobolds have a great gift for mining and stoneworking, and they often fill their lairs with cunning traps. But their culture is driven by tradition, and the kobolds have never sought to change or progress. They are the children of the dragons, vessels of the progenitors' will; change will come when the great dragons mandate it.

**Draconic Exemplar** You draw minor powers from your draconic exemplar. Choose a type of chromatic or metallic dragon to be your exemplar. This determines your scale color and appearance, and dragons sometimes look more favorably upon those kobolds who resemble them, at the GM's discretion. Your exemplar may also determine details of other abilities you have, using the Draconic Exemplars table.

# Heritages

You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

## Caveclimber Kobold

You live in a vertically-oriented home, and you're a consummate climber. You gain the Combat Climber skill feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. You can use your clawed feet and tail to Climb, leaving your hands free. Additionally, if you succeed at an Athletics check to Climb, you critically succeed instead.

{{{card "feat.skill.crb.combat-climber"}}}

## Cavern Kobold

You hatched into a warren among narrow tunnels and countless kin. Your body is flexible. When Climbing rock walls, stalactites, and other natural stone features, you move at half your Speed on a success and at full Speed on a critical success (and you move at full Speed on a success if you have Quick Climb). This doesn't affect you if you're using a climb Speed. If you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to Squeeze, you get a critical success instead.

## Dragonscaled Kobold

Your scales are especially colorful, possessing some of the same resistance a dragon possesses. You gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1) to the damage type associated with your draconic exemplar. Double this resistance against dragons' Breath Weapons.

## Spellscale Kobold

A trace of draconic magic flows through your veins. Choose one cantrip from the arcane spell list. You can Cast this Spell as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. You gain the trained proficiency rank in arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your key spellcasting ability is Charisma.

## Strongjaw Kobold

Your bloodline is noted for their powerful jaws and sharp teeth. You gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage. Your jaws are in the brawling group and have the finesse and unarmed traits.

## Tunnelflood Kobold

You grew up in a warren crisscrossed by underwater passages, whether natural or excavated. You gain a swim Speed of 15 feet.

## Venomtail Kobold

A vestigial spur in your tail secretes one dose of deadly venom each day. You gain the Tail Toxin action.

### Appearance

Kobolds are short reptilian humanoids with slender bodies and long tails. They often boast distant draconic ancestry, and every kobold displays one or more draconic features, such as stout horns, razor-sharp teeth, or---more rarely---vestigial wings or draconic breath.

The color of a kobold's scales can vary widely. Most often, they mimic the hues of chromatic or metallic dragons, with a mix of slightly darker or lighter scales that create a mottled appearance. The scales of newly hatched kobolds often reflect the community's draconic exemplar, whether that's the dragon they currently serve or the dragon type from which they're descended.

### Names

A young kobold's given name is rarely more than a syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and accomplish great deeds, kobolds add more syllables to their names, imitating a common draconic practice. Kobolds rarely have surnames except in an effort to better fit into a community, in which case they typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that group.
