The dragonborn came from Argonnessen, the continent of dragons; or that is the prevailing theory, at least. Dragonborn communities have also been spotted in Xen'drik and in Qbarra on Khorvaire, neither of which are willing to give any direct answers on their origins and possible ties to the Dragons of Argonnessen.

### Appearance

Dragonborn resemble humanoid dragons. They stand upright, and are covered in scales similar to a dragon, but they do not possess a dragon's tail. A typical dragonborn's scales can be a wide variety of colors. Unlike the dragons' color schemes, a dragonborn's colors rarely betray the dragonborn's abilities, including its breath weapon. Most dragonborn have very fine scales over most of their body and take on almost a leathery look, with much larger scales on their forearms, lower legs and feet, shoulders, and thighs.

Dragonborn stand tall and are built strongly. Their hands and feet are actually talon-like claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand. Their heads are elongated, with a blunt snout and distinctive frills on each side of their head. Behind their head, thick, ropy scales that resemble hair come down to their backs.

### Names

Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of honor. A childhood name or nickname is often used among clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term of endearment. The name might recall an event or center on a habit.
