Divine magic is usually the product of deep faith and unyielding conviction, but an aasimar has a direct tie to a source of divine power and receives guidance from a celestial entity. Usually, these gifts aren't hereditary, and you can't necessarily identify an aasimar in Eberron by their appearance; there is no single recognized trait that defines an aasimar, and no reliable way of producing one. While the existence of aasimar may seem to fly in the face of Eberron's distant gods, it's important to remember that an aasimar needs no direct connection to a deity. An aasimar draws power from a divine energy source, and their spiritual guide is a celestial being---an angel, a couatl, or similar spirit. The aasimar may be marked as a champion of the faith, but even they can't prove the existence of the Sovereigns.
