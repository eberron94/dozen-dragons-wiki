Built as mindless machines to fight in the Last War, the warforged developed sentience as a side effect of the arcane experiments that sought to make them the ultimate weapons of destruction. With each successive model that emerged from the creation forges of House Cannith, the warforged evolved until they became a new kind of creatureâ€”living constructs.

### Appearance

The warforged are made of stone, metal, and wood fibers. The core of a warforged is a skeletal frame made of metal and stone with wood fibers acting as a muscular system. Covering the warforged is an outer shell of metal and stone plates. An internal network of tubes run through the warforged's body; these tubes are filled with an alchemical blood-like fluid that is designed to lubricate and nourish their systems. Their hands have only two thick fingers and a thumb, whilst their feet only have two broad toes. Their body is sexless.

### Names

Warforged often take up the nicknames given to them by their friends, colleagues, and superiors though they also name themselves after their rank, job title, or something that describes an aspect of themselves. It is not rare for a warforged to change their name when they feel their old one no longer suits them. Others can take names from other races, such as humans.
