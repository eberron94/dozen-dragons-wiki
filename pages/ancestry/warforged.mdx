Built as mindless machines to fight in the Last War, the warforged developed sentience as a side effect of the arcane experiments that sought to make them the ultimate weapons of destruction. With each successive model that emerged from the creation forges of House Cannith, the warforged evolved until they became a new kind of creature---living constructs.

**Artificial Body** You are alive, but your physiological needs are different than those of living creatures. You don't need to eat or drink. You don't need to sleep, but you still need a daily period of rest. During this period of rest, you must enter a recuperating standby state for 2 hours, which is similar to sleeping except you are aware of your surroundings and don't take penalties for being unconscious. Much like with sleeping, if you go too long without entering your standby state, you become fatigued and can't recover until you enter standby for 2 hours.

**Composite Frame** The plating used to protect your wooden skeleton is a special type of armor, designed to be integrated directly with a warforged's frame. You can only wear armor with the Component trait, this prevents you from wearing traditional armor. This armor is not natural armor so runes can be engraved on it. While you live, the armor incorporated into your body can't be removed against your will. If you are forced into a suit of armor, you do not benefit from the AC Bonus but the Dex Cap, Check Penalty, and Speed Penalty are still applied.

**Living Construct** You don't have the typical construct immunities, can be affected by effects that target a living creature, and can recover Hit Points normally via positive energy. Additionally, you are not destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. Instead, your life energy attempts to keep you active even in dire straits; you are knocked out and begin dying when reduced to 0 Hit Points. When a creature would attempt a Treat Wounds action on you, they must attempt a Craft check instead of a Medicine check, and must use their Craft skill proficiency to determine the check DC and amount of Hit Points healed.

# Heritages

You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

## Juggernaut

You were designed to be larger and sturdier than other warforged. You gain 12 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 8. Increase your maximum and encumbered Bulk limits by 1.

## Scout

You were designed to be more nimble. Your Speed is 30 feet instead of 25 feet. When you take the Scout action, you can move at full speed instead of half speed.

## Utility

You were designed to work in non-combat situations. You are trained in one skill of your choice, and start knowing two additional languages of your choice.

### Appearance

The warforged are made of stone, metal, and wood fibers. The core of a warforged is a skeletal frame made of metal and stone with wood fibers acting as a muscular system. Covering the warforged is an outer shell of metal and stone plates. An internal network of tubes run through the warforged's body; these tubes are filled with an alchemical blood-like fluid that is designed to lubricate and nourish their systems. Their hands have only two thick fingers and a thumb, whilst their feet only have two broad toes. Their body is sexless.

### Names

Warforged often take up the nicknames given to them by their friends, colleagues, and superiors though they also name themselves after their rank, job title, or something that describes an aspect of themselves. It is not rare for a warforged to change their name when they feel their old one no longer suits them. Others can take names from other races, such as humans.

**Example Names** Azm, Book, Bulwark, Cart, Charger, Cutter, Falchion, Graven, Hammer, Mark, Morg, Nameless, Pierce, Pious, Relic, Rune, Steeple, Sword, Three, Titan, Unsung, Victor, Watcher, Zealot.

### Key Terms

You will see the following key terms associated with warforged equipment.

**Attachment** These equipment are attached to the wielder's body, typically a warforged. The process of attaching one of these weapons takes time similar to donning and removing armor. Attaching and removing one of these weapons are both activities involving many Interact actions. It takes 1 minute to attach or remove a weapon. While attached, the weapon takes up the use of the hand. When a creature rolls a Critical Success to {{{ref "Disarm"}}} you, they instead get a Success.

**Component Plate** These unique sets of armor are designed to be integrated with a warforged's skeletal frame. The process of integrating these armor sets takes as long as as donning and removing heavy armor, no matter the type of armor the item actual is.

**Retractable** The weapon is usually attached to a device, and can be retracted into the device, or be extended for fighting. You can extend or retract the weapon as an action.
