Certain classes, like Alchemist, gain a feature that lets them create infused items. There are two methods of creating these items.

# Prepared Infusions

A prepared infusion is created during your daily preparations, usually in batches, and becomes inert during your next daily preparations.

# Quick Infusions

A quick infusion is created with an action, usually only making a single item, and becomes inert at the end of your turn.
