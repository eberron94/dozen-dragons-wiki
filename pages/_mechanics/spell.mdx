There are two types of spellcasters, prepared and spontaneous. Whether a spellcasting character is a prepared caster or a spontaneous caster is determined by their class.

# Prepared Spellcasting

Prepared spellcasters, like Clerics, Druids, and Wizards, must spend time each day preparing spells for the day. At the start of the day, players select a number of spells of different spell levels determined by their character's level and class. The character's spells remain prepared until cast or until the character prepares spells again.

Each prepared spell is expended after a single casting, so in order to cast a particular spell more than once in a day, that spell will have to be prepared multiple times. The exceptions to this rule are spells with the cantrip trait; once prepared for the day, cantrips can be cast an unlimited number of times.

Some abilities allow characters to swap prepared spells or perform other aspects of preparing spells at different times throughout the day, but only a character's daily preparation counts for the purpose of effects that last until spells are next prepared.

# Spontaneous Spellcasting

Some classes, such as bards and sorcerers, are spontaneous spellcasters. Unlike prepared spellcasters who allocate which spell slots can be expended to cast a particular spell at the beginning of the day, Spontaneous spellcasters choose which spell is cast at the moment that a spell slot is expended. This increased flexibility comes at the cost of spontaneous spellcasters generally knowing fewer spells.

# Heightened Spells

Spells can be cast at a higher spell level than that listed for the spell. For example, Fireball, a third-level spell, is heightened when it is cast with a fourth-level spell slot. This is called heightening the spell. When a spell is heightened, the spell's level increases to match the higher level of the spell slot being expanded to cast the spell. Many spells have additional effects when they are heightened; these extra benefits are described at the end of the spell's stat block. Some spells can be heightened at multiple different levels, and may have separate entries for different heightened levels at the end of the spell's stat block; only apply the effects listed for the level to which the spell has been heightened. Other heightened spell entries give a number after a plus sign, indicating that the heightening grants extra advantages over multiple levels The listed effect applies for every increment of levels buy which the spell is heightened above its lowest spell level, and the benefit is cumulative. For example, the spell Fireball says "Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6." This means that when the spell Fireball is cast at a heightened level, its damage increases by 2d6 for every level it is heightened above its base level.

Both prepared and spontaneous spellcasters can cast heightened spells. A prepared spellcaster heightens a spell by preparing it in a higher-level spell slot than the original level (e.g., Fireball a is heightened when it is prepared with a fourth-level spell slot). Spontaneous spellcasters heighten a spell by casting it using a higher-level spell slot; however, a spontaneous spellcaster must first know the spell at the heightened level (e.g., Fireball is heightened when a spontaneous caster knows fireball at the fourth level and casts it using a fourth level spell slot.) Spontaneous casters can know a spell at multiple levels. Additionally, many spontaneous spellcasting classes provide abilities that allow a character to cast a limited number of spells as heightened versions even if the character only knows the spell at a single level.
