Cyran avengers remember where they were and what they were doing on the Day of Mourningâ€”the day their nation was destroyed. A few bore witness to the cataclysm firsthand and were driven from their homeland by rolling clouds of dead-gray mist. Others were fighting battles on foreign soil that day and escaped the devastation. They have spent the past four years piecing together their shattered lives and coming to grips with the loss of friends and family. Now, these vindictive survivors seek to uncover the cause of the cataclysm and avenge their people against the architects of the Mournland. Cyran avengers also harbor lingering animosity toward those who threatened or betrayed Cyre during the Last War, and they struggle daily to harness or put aside this hatred. They refuse to believe that Cyre had any hand in its own destruction or that the Cyran people should be unduly punished while the remaining Five Nations enjoy the peace afforded by the Treaty of Thronehold.



**Requirement** You must be a former native of Cyre to be a Cyran avenger. Moreover, you must have the courage and survival skills required to uncover the truth about what happened to Cyre and punish rival nations for the wounds they inflicted upon your people during the Last War.
