The deadgrim are an elite faction within the Red Watchers, a new organization of undead hunters within Karrnath. While all watchers dedicate their lives to cleansing their homeland of undead, the deadgrim range beyond Karrnath and go further in their purpose---adopting some of the powers of their hated foes to better understand and combat them. The deadgrim walk a tenuous line between becoming that which they loathe, endlessly struggling with the dark call of power represented by undeath. So far none have fallen, but the order is young.

**Access** Deadgrim are of diverse backgrounds, but one common theme unites them: a hatred of the undead. All have had personal encounters with such creatures, and many have lost family members or close friends to the undead. Many are clerics of the Silver Flame, Dol Arrah, or Dol Dorn.

> This archetype is Knight Reclaimant.
