Faction based archetypes are tied to Eberron in some way. Each archetype will list is original name (in case you are looking for an archetype you saw on Archives of Nethys) or will credit the homebrewer that made it.

> While faction archetypes are tied to some part of the lore, it is only really a suggestion. If you have a concept and a faction archetype fits, ask the GM for ways to reflavor the mechanics to best suite your idea.
