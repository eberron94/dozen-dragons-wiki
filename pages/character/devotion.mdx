Your devotion is the reason you adventure. Below are some example devotions. The devotion has no mechanical benefit, just a means to have you think about why your character is an adventurer.

# Chronicler

> "_What a story!_" -Kalva Dannor, gnome bard

When you can sell a story to a publication such as the Korranberg Chronicle or the Sharn Inquisitive, everything that happens around you starts to look like a story that needs to be written. You seek out adventure wherever you can find it---but you sometimes act more like an observer than a participant.

**Adventuring**: You grew up reading about the Last War in the pages of the Korranberg Chronicle, and thought that it sounded exciting. You imagined yourself huddled in a tent near the front lines, scrawling a dispatch that you would send back to Korranberg to be read across the Five Nations. Of course, once you finally got a job writing for a small local chronicle, you spent more time talking to farmers about their crops than you did doing anything remotely resembling adventuring. Now you've made it: You travel with a group of adventurers, write about your experiences, and sell the stories to any chronicle that buys them. At least, sometimes you sell the stories.

The primary criterion by which you judge whether to undertake an adventure is whether or not you think it will make a good story. By "good story," you might mean one that's dramatic and exciting, or you might mean one that will sell. Other factors are less important: Will your participation make a difference in the world? Are innocent lives at stake? Does the adventure itself pay well? It doesn't matter---as long as it makes a good story.

If nothing else, an adventure could at least get you close to a big story that's otherwise unrelated to the adventure itself. If someone wants to hire a group of bodyguards for an airship journey, you might not show any interest at all---until you learn that an important noble or famous diplomat will be on the same airship, on a mysterious mission. Now that's a good story!

**Personality**: Young chroniclers approach their task with exuberant enthusiasm, excited at the prospect of turning their experiences into gripping tales that will thrill a new generation of readers. Is that you, or has your attitude devolved into a bitter cynicism? It's easy to fall into the jaded view that chronicling is a pretty word for lying, trying to make the horrors of war or the terrors of the world sound exciting. But hey, excitement sells stories, so you'll make the story as lurid as possible to make the sale.

**Behavior**: Take notes about everything your companions do. You might even be tempted to hang back out of combat for a moment or two while you finish scribbling your notes about the events that led to the combat. (Don't take this to the point where your allies become angry at your inaction. Finish jotting down notes instead of moving in between spells or other helpful actions.) Most important, act as though you were a character in an exciting story that will be told around the world---be dramatic, be dynamic, take risks, and live large.

**Language**: Words are your livelihood. Describe your own actions as if you were writing them for a popular audience. You might refer to yourself in the third person when talking with NPCs, either by name or as "your intrepid chronicler" or "your humble scribe." Describe the actions of your companions and your enemies in the same way when recalling your stories to others. When your companions do something dramatic or memorable, narrate what happened, even as you continue fighting.

**Variants**: You could be an aspiring storyteller hoping to gain experience so you can "write what you know." You might write for the chronicles, but with a focus on exposing corruption or scandal rather than telling thrilling tales. Or you might simply enjoy being where things are happening, or being around famous and important people, and writing for a chronicle is an effective way of accomplishing that goal.

# Devotee of the Host

> "_Sovereigns preserve us."_ -Kuduth, khoravar champion

Even if you're not a cleric, the deities of the Sovereign Host are important to you. You were brought up to show them proper reverence, and devotion to the ideals they represent guides your every step.

**Adventuring**: You have been profoundly influenced by a particular cycle of myths relating to the Sovereign Host and the Dark Six---myths that are no longer widely told, but that have inspired countless generations of heroes to take up arms against the forces of evil in the world. These myths are collectively called the Rebellion Saga, and they speak of the original and ongoing rebellion of the Dark Six against the rule of the Sovereigns. According to these ancient tales, it is the work of the devout to bring the Dark Six back into the fold, which will be accomplished by quelling their rebellious followers.

Naturally, reuniting the Dark Six with the rest of the pantheon is not likely to happen any time soon, although certain apocalyptic groups believe in its inevitability. Thus, for most adventuring devotees, quelling the rebellion by slaying monsters, imprisoning necromancers, and proselytizing changelings is little more than a good long-term justification for actions that also make sense in the short term, by making the world safer for the civilized races of Khorvaire.

**Personality**: Your devotion to the Host shines through everything you do---at least, you hope it does. When you enter battle, you try to reflect the strength of Dol Dorn and the honor of Dol Arrah. You offer prayers to Olladra, Arawai, and Balinor before eating, to Onatar before using your crafting skills, and to Aureon every time you cast a spell. You protect families and villages in imitation of Boldrei, and you guard caravans and merchants for Kol Korran's sake.

**Behavior**: Your devotion is your defining characteristic, but it describes little about your personality. You are not necessarily a prude, a pacifist, or a philanthropist, though you might be any of those things. You try to wrap everything you do in a shroud of religious devotion. You probably don't do it consciously to try to impress others; rather, you do it because that's how you've learned to do things. You might feel that everything you make should be dedicated to Onatar, but the prayers you recite out of habit while crafting are only the outward expression of that intrinsic belief.

**Language**: Prayers, oaths, and invocations pepper your speech. Generic invocations of the Sovereigns serve many purposes, such as "Sovereigns preserve us! " or simply "Sovereigns!" used as an expression of surprise or frustration. Curses often use the names of the Dark Six: "Aureon's Shadow!" or "Keeper take you!" are common ones. Feel free to improvise short prayers to Dol Dorn for wading into battle, to Olladra before eating, and so on.

**Variants**: You might be devoted to a particular deity of the Sovereign Host rather than the entire pantheon. If you worship the Silver Flame, look at the Templar of the Silver Flame prestige class instead. If you follow the Path of Light or revere the Undying Court, your specific motivations and oaths will vary, but your basic personality could resemble either this archetype or the Silver Flame templar.

# House Renegade

> "_I prefer not to use my family name, thank you._" -Gaven, khoravar ranger

Sometimes being a member of a dragonmarked house means power, prestige, and influence. Sometimes it means living firmly under the thumb of a controlling relative until you can find a way to escape. Congratulations---you've found a way.

**Adventuring**: You adventure because it's better than the alternative, a tightly controlled life as part of a dragonmarked house. Your family thinks you should be home, putting your talents to use in the service of your house. Your mother wants you where she can keep an eye on you and make sure you don't get into any trouble. Your father wants to find you someone appropriate to marry and keep your children close at hand.

Fundamentally, you adventure because you know your family hates it. You might not know yet what you want to do with your life---adventuring might just be something you're doing to kill time until you figure it out---but you know it won't involve the work of your house.

**Personality**: Clearly, you've got a rebellious streak. You don't necessarily reject all authority, but you certainly don't like to be under anyone's thumb. You can be sardonic, cynical, and harsh sometimes, especially when the people around you start sounding like they think they own you. But you're not bad at heart. Is it so wrong to want to shape your own destiny?

**Behavior**: Even though you've probably been disowned, you're used to a life of relative luxury, and your habits and mannerisms reflect that. You prefer to stay in upper-class hotels rather than common inns, and to feast in a private dining room rather than squeeze in to a spot at the board to get your share of stew with the peasants. That said, you have a lot more respect for the working classes than most people of your station, and you're not inclined to boss people around or expect doting service. These people have aspirations and dreams of their own---you can't follow yours without encouraging them to follow theirs.

**Language**: You were brought up well, and your manner of speaking reflects that. You have an educated vocabulary and a solid grasp of correct grammar. You avoid slang and vulgar language, unless you intend to shock or provoke. Of course, house renegades live to shock and provoke, especially when they know that others have preconceived notions of how they ought to behave and want to shake up those opinions.

**Variants**: You might be a younger child of a noble family rather than a dragonmarked house, or even a former rising star in a church hierarchy fleeing from the controlling influence of a religious mentor. In addition, your reasons for fleeing your family might vary: Perhaps you committed a crime, or a change in power in your house left you out of favor.

# House Scion

> "_Yes, father, I realize this reflects poorly on our house. I apologize._" -Ural d'Orien, human inventor

Forget the noble families of Galifar---the real power lies in the hands of the dragonmarked houses. You are a member of one of those houses, and though power comes with any number of responsibilities, you welcome your familial duties as a reasonable price to pay for the social, political, economic, and magical power to which you are heir.

**Adventuring**: Adventuring has to fit in with the duties that come to you by virtue of your house membership. With luck, the two coincide perfectly: You undertake adventures at the behest of the head of your house or some other prominent figure (perhaps a parent), performing missions that advance the aims of the house or simply bring treasures into its coffers. When you're not so lucky, you still need to bear your house's interests in mind---looking for opportunities to advance your own house or deal a setback to a competing one. Any secrets you unearth or treasures you claim can benefit your house, and anything that hurts another house helps yours.

**Personality**: You were born to power and have come to view it as your birthright. You can be imperious, arrogant, and spoiled at times, and at the best of times you are smugly superior. You can also be calculating, dispassionate, and even amoral, depending on your alignment---the demands of your house sometimes do not coincide with the expectations of traditional morality. You are comfortable in rigid, well-defined structures of authority, as long as you know your place in them.

**Behavior**: You are used to a life of comfort, and take pains to keep up to that standard while adventuring, perhaps even to the point of using Leomund's secure shelter while traveling through the jungle so that you can rest comfortably at night. Depending on who your adventuring companions are, you might see their company as a necessary evil for the work you must do, preferring the company of others while you are in cities between adventures. You might even spend the evenings, while your companions are sharing tales around the campfire, writing letters to your true friends and dear family members back home.

**Language**: You were brought up well, and your manner of speaking reflects it. You have an educated vocabulary and a solid grasp of correct grammar. Avoid slang, vulgar language, and even contractions.

**Variants**: Rather than a member of a dragonmarked house, you could be part of a noble family, such as one of the noble houses of Galifar or a prominent family of Aerenal. Alternatively, you could be part of the rising middle class in one of Khorvaire's splendid metropolises, born to wealth without any privilege of name or title.

# Innocent Victim

> "_Why is all this happening to me?_" -Lira Raevan, human bard

Bad things happen to you all the time, but through a combination of amazing luck, phenomenal resourcefulness, and maybe a dash of a greater destiny, you always seem to come through.

**Adventuring**: Most people adventure because they choose to, for one reason or another. Not you. If you had a choice in the matter, you'd be back home living a quiet life where nothing extraordinary ever happens. But ever since the day when the Emerald Claw agents burst into your home looking for you, or you woke up and found yourself in a strange forest with a dragon saying you were part of the Prophecy, or you manifested psionic or magical powers you never knew you had---ever since then, this lightning-rail ride of a life has been moving so quickly that you don't know how to jump off and get things back to normal.

Maybe there is something special about you. You could have unusual powers, or play a key role in a prophecy (draconic or otherwise), or maybe a shard of an ancient artifact is embedded in your flesh. For whatever reason, other people are far more interested in your life than you yourself used to be. You've managed to keep one step ahead of them so far---or maybe you haven't, and "they" are your adventuring companions.

**Personality**: You are somewhat bewildered about all the events that have brought you to this point in your life. You don't understand why people are so interested in you, and you often wish they'd just leave you alone. You'd rather not go through all these harrowing adventures, but some greater force in the world seems to have decreed that adventuring is your lot in life, so you've had to figure out how to make the best of it.

Take care not to degenerate into constant whining and complaining, or your companions will quickly tire of both it and you. You've been thrust into the spotlight against your will; if you speak softly and try to deflect that attention, maybe things will quiet down soon. Also, don't assume that every adventure should be about you and the people who are after you. Don't ever believe that you are as important as people seem to think you are.

**Behavior**: Cling to the illusion of being an ordinary person yanked unwillingly into a life of adventure for as long as possible. Practice your crafting, profession, or performing skills as if you intend to make a living with them someday. Rely on your adventuring companions for some degree of protection, while looking for ways to contribute materially to any situation without intentionally meaning to.

**Language**: You are soft-spoken and unassuming. Downplay your own importance and any successes you accomplish. If you kill a grick with your sword---well, that sure was lucky, wasn't it? And those agents of the Chamber, they couldn't possibly be looking for you.

**Variants**: You might suffer from amnesia, and your adventuring career is an attempt to recover the knowledge and abilities you have lost. If others are interested in you, it's because of who you were before losing your memory---in which case your enemies might hold the secret to uncovering your own past.

# Inquisitive

> "_If you're the ambassador, I'm the Lord of Blades. Now, how about the truth?_" -Creilath Movanek, khoravar rogue

As a resident of one of Khorvaire's great cities, you've spent far too much time immersed in its shadows. You've seen it all, and nothing fazes you anymore.

**Adventuring**: Adventuring, to you, is all about investigating crimes and making sure the criminals get what they're due. You probe murders, find missing people, stop blackmailers, and break up smuggling rings. Your investigations are not necessarily limited to such mundane problems: You might unmask a rakshasa posing as a city councilor, find the possessed ancient mask that forced the professor to commit all those grisly murders, or dispel the magic keeping the house scion's son in his comatose slumber.

This devotion is best suited for a campaign with a limited geographical scope, whether it takes place in a single metropolis (such as Sharn) or hops from city to city. Occasional adventures might take you out into the wilderness, but you're most at home in dark alleys and bustling roadways.

**Personality**: The city's underbelly can be a bleak place, and that fact has certainly had an effect on your disposition. You're so used to corruption and crime that you don't expect to meet honest people, and you're surprised at acts of selflessness and sacrifice. "Jaded" doesn't begin to describe how cynical and bitter you can be in your worst moments. You've been cheated so many times that you always ask for money up front. You've seen so much hatred and death that nothing shocks you at this point---or at least that's the image you project.

Deep inside, there might be a part of you that still mourns over every corpse you find sprawled in an alley, still grieves for the lost soul of humanity and its kin, and still believers there might be some hope and goodness left in the world. But you know full well that if anyone sees that tiny part of you, they'll exploit it---or at least mock it mercilessly.

**Behavior**: Cultivate behavior that conveys just how tough you are. Sharpen your sword or fiddle with a dagger during down time. Never open a door when you can kick it in. You might be able to talk your way out of tricky situations, but you should also be prepared to fight your way out: The kinds of people you deal with usually prefer to fight.

> There's a fine line between playing an archetype and parodying a stereotype, and the inquisitive might be the most prone to crossing that line---if only because the fine prose of Raymond Chandler (The Big Sleep) has itself been subjected to so much parody and unflattering imitation. Playing an Eberron inquisitive as a bad Philip Marlowe imitation can drive the whole world into parody. If you drink Zil brandy, wait for a call on the speaking stone, and talk like Humphrey Bogart on a bad day, then Eberron starts to look like a ridiculous parody of the modern world, with magic simply duplicating all the technological wizardry of Earth's 1930s.

> You can be hard-bitten and tough as nails and still fit into the magical/medieval world of Eberron. Think about the essence of your character---a tough nut who has seen the worst the world has to offer but refuses to be corrupted by it---and strip away the elements that have become stereotypical. You don't need to rely on old clichés of behavior and language.

**Language**: The wisecrack is like an off-hand weapon for you. In every battle, you can attack with your primary weapon and get in a verbal barb or two as well. Even when you're not in combat, your speech reflects your cynicism.

**Variants**: You might be a freelance investigator or work for a law-enforcement organization. For a slightly different take on this archetype, you could work in espionage, focusing on intrigue among nations or dragonmarked houses rather than crime on a local scale.

# Outlander

> "_Your cities have made you soft and weak!_" -Corrash, halfling barbarian

Like a wolf cut off from its pack, you are a member of a barbarian culture (not necessarily an actual barbarian) away from your tribe. You wander through the civilized world bewildered and isolated, looking for companions you can rely on.

**Adventuring**: Your goals and approach to adventuring are probably closely linked to the reason you left your homeland and family. You might be on a quest to find some item or piece of knowledge of significance to your people---a relic that can cure the plague ravaging your clan, a tome that will reveal the nature of the demon that hunts them, or an artifact that explains your people's history or some aspect of it. Alternatively, you might be seeking to prove yourself---to exonerate yourself of a crime, to win the hand of the chieftain, or simply to secure your position as an adult in your community. Or you might have been banished from your clan for a crime you actually did commit, and are forever unable to return.

You might eventually grow so accustomed to life among more civilized people that you don't want to return , or become restless and uneasy among your own people when you see them again.

**Personality**: Your attitude toward civilization is your defining characteristic. Decide how you view the civilized society around you as well as your sophisticated allies, and try to see everything around you through that lens. Do you maintain a superior contempt for their soft and weak ways, or do you find those ways alluring? Do you wander wideeyed through the magnificent towers of Sharn, marveling at the achievements of magic and technology, or do you feel trapped any time you're forced to remain indoors? When you return to lands that are more comfortable and familiar to you, change your behavior drastically---take on more of a leadership role, or revert to a role like the one you have in your homeland, whatever that role might be.

**Behavior**: Most outlanders make some effort to practice the traditions and rituals of their homeland no matter how far they travel. You might do this simply out of habit, even if you repudiate the beliefs and mores of your people. These minor rituals might include hanging charms around a sleeping place, pouring out wine to the cardinal directions before drinking, taking souvenir body parts from slain foes, or invoking the names of patron spirits or totems at frequent intervals.

**Language**: Even if you are not entirely comfortable speaking karrnon, you are just as capable as anyone of expressing complex thoughts and sophisticated ideas in your own language. Scatter phrases of your native language into your speech. Struggle for words sometimes, as if trying to find the right way to express something complex or idiomatic that comes naturally to you in your native tongue. Avoid accents unless you can pull one off without sounding goofy.

**Variants**: Warforged as a race are similar to outlanders in that human society can seem strange and alien to them, but they have nothing to compare it to, except perhaps a life in the military during the Last War. As an alternative, your background might be considerably more exotic: Perhaps you were raised by wolves or a lammasu, or brought up on a different plane of existence.

# Restless Wanderer

> "_It's time to stretch my legs, flex my sword arm, and give this quill something worthwhile to record._" -Thunvarch, half-orc bard

The world is a big place, and you have no desire to settle down until you've seen it all. You move from place to place as freely as the wind---blowing through the boring spots, lingering for a while in more interesting locations, and sometimes kicking up a storm.

**Adventuring**: Adventures are what happens to you while you travel. If you seek out adventure, it's because a place sounds interesting, not because there's anything in particular you want to accomplish there. You are eager to visit new places, try new modes of transportation, see creatures you've never seen before, and (at least to some extent) do things you've never done. If you can also learn new abilities, acquire more treasure, and otherwise improve yourself along the way, that's even better.

**Personality**: You've always had trouble sitting still. Perhaps you grew up in a tiny village where there was nothing to do, and yearned for a taste of the wider world. Some experience of the world beyond your village might have sparked your wanderlust: Perhaps a traveling troupe of actors or musicians came through, or a party of adventurers stayed in the village for a couple of weeks while exploring nearby ruins. That experience gave substance to your dreams of a different life---you might even have followed the travelers out of town, launching your life of wandering in a dramatic way. You still retain some of that youthful, wide-eyed dreaminess and a sense that the world is full of wonders just waiting to be explored. You are not necessarily naive about life's harsh realities, but you retain a sense of wonder that no amount of bitter experience has yet been able to quash.

You might have a particular interest that gives a focus to your wandering. Perhaps you are particularly drawn to spectacular natural wonders such as the Goradra Gap or the Guardian Trees. Or maybe you're fascinated with ancient ruins, great monuments, or exotic cultures.

**Behavior**: Stay on the move. Whenever you feel that a dungeon room, a site, a nation, or even a continent has shown you all it has to reveal, it's time to move on. You can spend all the time you want searching the rooms of a dungeon---as long as there are interesting things to find. But you should be the first member of your party to call a halt to tedium whenever it arises and get things moving again.

**Language**: Your mind wanders even faster than your body, making your speech seem disconnected at times. Pepper your conversation with wide-eyed observations about the sights, sounds, and smells of whatever place you're exploring now and comparisons to places you've been before.

**Variants**: Not all wanderers are motivated by wanderlust. Instead, you might be on the run---a fugitive hunted by agents of a widespread organization, such as the Dreaming Dark, the Aurum, the Chamber, the Lords of Dust, or a dragonmarked house. If you stay in any one place too long, they're certain to find you. So you keep moving, you try to avoid attracting notice, and you don't talk much about your past.

# Scholar-Adventurer

> "_What I haven't figured out yet is whether there's any connection between the Tablet of Shummarak and the Place of Imprisonment mentioned in the Serpentes Fragments. If there is, that could explain a lot._" -Janik Martell, human alchemist

Eberron is rich in history, and equally rich in people who study history. Not content to sit in a library surrounded by dusty tomes and crumbling potsherds, you do your research in the field---whether in the cyclopean ruins of Xen'drik or the ancient tunnels of Dorasharn beneath the City of Towers.

**Adventuring**: For you, history is about discovering the mysteries of Eberron's ancient empires by exploring the ruins of Xen'drik's lost kingdoms and the remnants of goblin civilization in Khorvaire. You yearn to discover mighty artifacts and lost magical secrets. You hunger for knowledge about the past, and you have never been content to gain your knowledge from other people or the books they write. You want to drink from the source, and that means adventure.

**Personality**: You combine a solid grounding in academic research and established knowledge with a thirst for action and adventure. You have an inquisitive mind and are always wondering about the reasons why things happen and possible connections between apparently unrelated events. Your collection of scholarly tomes is like a group of old friends---you don't necessarily see them every day, but you're happy to spend hours in their company whenever you can. Your name is well known in academic circles: Some of your fellow scholars praise you to the skies, while others dismiss you as a hack.

**Behavior**: Take notes on everything. Copy diagrams and inscriptions into your notebooks. Collect samples of body parts from unusual monsters---or even entire monsters, if you can transport them. Treat shattered ceramics and magical relics as equally interesting, even as you recognize that magic items are more valuable and far more useful. You might be hesitant to use anything or go anywhere until you have properly researched it, or you might rush in to do your research on-site.

Look for opportunities to use your various areas of knowledge. They might not happen very often, but that just makes it all the more memorable when you do glean some useful information from your studies of architecture and engineering!

**Language**: Drop the names of scholars both renowned and obscure into your conversations. Introduce theories and observations by citing tangentially relevant research. When you encounter a monster, try to come up with a useful reminder about its capabilities to share with your companions, gleaned from the knowledge you've accumulated.

**Variants**: You need not be obsessed with ancient history and long-lost secrets---the world has its share of contemporary secrets as well. What caused the Mourning? What is the truth behind the Blood of Vol? What lies in the interior of Argonnessen? Who are the mysterious rulers of Riedra? These questions are out there, waiting for you to explore them and plumb their depths.

# Streetwise Scoundrel

> "_Don't ask how I know this guy, I just know this guy who can help us out, all right?_" -R'kash, shifter rogue

Not every hero is born to privilege in a noble family or a dragonmarked house. You certainly weren't, though you might hesitate to call yourself a hero. The streets are your home---the gutters, truth be told---and you know the back alleys and the criminals of your home city as well as you know your own gear.

**Adventuring**: If there's a better way than adventuring to earn a quick fortune, you haven't found it yet. It's a perfect deal: You can make use of the survival skills you learned growingup on the streets, you gain some measure of respectability, and you occasionally find bags of gold pieces, which hold more money than you can imagine anyone actually using. (Though you're more than willing to try.)

The driving force in your adventuring life is, whether you admit it or not, a burning desire to escape the circumstances you grew up in. You want to make a life for yourself that's better than the poverty and crime that defined your youth. You want money, certainly, but more than that you want respect, dignity, a sense of meaning and purpose, and a shred of hope. You definitely do not want to die, alone and friendless, and be left to rot in an abandoned sewer tunnel. In your adventuring career, that's one risk you would just as soon not take. You want to live to enjoy your hard-earned wealth.

**Personality**: You know the ways of the street. You're acquainted with unsavory characters, you know how to get certain things done even if they're not quite legal, and you have more than a passing familiarity with the slang, signals, and methods used by criminals. You might not be an outlaw yourself---at least, not now---but the criminal underworld is your world, for better or worse. You have a sense of ethics and honor, primarily focused on the idea that you don't turn on your friends. But actions that might make a paladin of the Silver Flame cringe are just the way things get done to your mind---actions such as paying bribes, fencing valuable goods, or stealing magic tomes from your enemies. You're wary of officers of the law, even if you have committed no crimes. You've had too many bad experiences with the town watch arresting you or your friends for no good reason other than your poverty.

**Behavior**: You're fidgety. You pick things up and put them back down, fiddle with moving parts, or pace if you have nothing interesting to hold in your hands. When you're in a small room, you stay on your feet near the door---you don't want to be trapped. When your companions are talking to the city watch, you stay in the back of the group or out of sight completely. But when they need to find the lost goblin shrine in the depths of Sharn, you step right up and lead the way. That's your chance to shine.

**Language**: You speak the language of the street. Slang is your native language, and your grammar is probably poor by the standards of a noble or otherwise well-educated individual. You talk tough to back up your swagger and wisecrack to deflect any probing questions about your background. You probably know words and expressions that would make a sailor blush, and you might forget not to use them in respectable company---especially when you're very angry.

**Variants**: Perhaps you were not born poor, but fell into poverty at a young age. Your parents might have been disowned by their dragonmarked house, or they staked all their money on a business venture that failed. Perhaps they were natives of Cyre who lost everything they had on the Day of Mourning. In this case, your driving ambition is not so much a matter of wanting what you could never have as a child, but of regaining the status that should have been yours by birthright---the wealth and power you deserve.

# War-torn Hero

"_After a hundred years of fighting, any idiot could see that the whole war was pointless._" -Dania ir'Vran, human fighter

Khorvaire is largely defined by the travails of the LastWar, and that is just as true of its adventurers. You fought on the front lines of the Last War. You killed a great many enemy soldiers, and you carry plenty of scars---on your body and on your soul.

**Adventuring**: You adventure because you can't think of anything else to do. You joined the army as soon as you were old enough and never learned a peacetime trade. Alter years spent in war, you can't just go back to your place of birth and learn to be a blacksmith. Your home might not even be there anymore. Adventuring seems like the only option left to you, and it offers the opportunity to continue using the skills you learned on the battlefield. In some cases, it might even be a literal continuation of your wartime activities---such as chasing Valenar raiders across the Talenta Plains or racing Emerald Claw agents to Xen'drik ruins.

As a member of an adventuring party, you have a sense of belonging and companionship. You have a steady source of wealth, more than enough to live comfortably. You have some sense of purpose and meaning in your life. You've made a reasonable approximation of the one thing you really want and can never again have: a home where you belong.

**Personality**: The war savaged your soul far worse than it could ever hurt your body, and you remain bitterly wounded. Your life is a contradiction. Violence sickens you. You saw so much death and mutilation in the course of the war that you had to steel yourself to it; still, you can never shake the waves of disgust that course through you when violence is necessary. But you live by violence, and you're not sure you know how to give it up.

**Behavior**: You cling to the discipline of military life because it is comfortable and familiar. You rise early in the morning and practice weapon or spell routines. You like to know the chain of command in your adventuring party and prefer clear orders about standard operating procedure. Even if some chaotic part of your belief system chafes at these disciplines, a larger part of you relies on them to give meaning and structure to every day. Without them, your life might just fall apart.

**Language**: Yours is the language of combat. You have a rich vocabulary to describe the maneuvers of the battlefield and various aspects of your daily life. You speak of base camps and rations, of reconnaissance and sabotage. To some extent, just like your practice of military discipline, using military terminology helps to keep your life ordered in your mind.

**Variants**: The warforged as a race are almost by definition war-torn heroes. However, their emotional response to the transition from wartime to peace varies widely, and warforged are less bitter and wounded than war-torn humanoids.
