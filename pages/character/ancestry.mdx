Your ancestry determines which people you call your own, whether it's diverse and ambitious humans, insular and enigmatic elves, family-focused khoravar, or any of the other folks who call Eberron home. Your ancestry and experiences prior to your life as an adventurer---represented by a background from step 2---might be key parts to your identity, shape how you see the world, and help you find a place in it.

# Ancestry

Ancestries are broken up into four groups based on how likely you are to meet someone of that ancestry: common; uncommon; rare; and unique. See the [Ancestries](/ancestry.html) page for the full list of options.

A unique feature of the common ancestries is bloodlines that have manifested dragonmarks, glowing marks on their skin that grant its bearer powerful magic. See the [Dragonmarks](/dragonmark.html) page for the full list of options.

# Heritage

Most ancestries will also have you choose a heritage. This can be subtle things that set your ancestry apart of each other, or full physiological differences. Once chosen, they cannot be changed.
