# Class

Your class defines how you interact with the game. Within the fiction of the game, your class is your source of strength. Did you make a pact with a dragon or train relentlessly as a soldier?

# Languages

You automatically know Karrnon. You start the campaign knowing a number of additional languages equal to your intelligence modifier + 1.

Not all languages can be learned freely. You can start knowing one 5th or 3rd level language and any languages listed in your culture. All other known languages must be level 1. 

**Special** Druid start the game knowing Vvark, which is the druidic language.
