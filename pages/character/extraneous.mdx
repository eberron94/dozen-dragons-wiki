The final step to finishing your character is to determine your class, ability scores, and languages. Once this is done and you have filled in your character sheet, you are ready to play the game.

# Class

A class gives your character access to a suite of heroic abilities, determines how effectively they fight, and governs how easily they can shake off or avoid certain harmful effects. Each class is fully detailed on their own page under Classes, but the summaries on the Classes page provides an overview of each and tells you which ability scores are important when playing that class.

# Ability Scores

One of the most important aspects of your character is their ability scores. These scores represent your character's raw potential and influence nearly every other statistic on your character sheet. Determining your ability scores is not done all at once, but instead happens over several steps during character creation.

Ability scores are split into two main groups: physical and mental. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution are physical ability scores, measuring your character's physical power, agility, and stamina. In contrast, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are mental ability scores and measure your character's learned prowess, awareness, and force of personality.

Excellence in an ability score improves the checks and statistics related to that ability, as described below. When imagining your character, you should also decide what ability scores you want to focus on to give you the best chance at success.

**Strength** Strength measures your character's physical power. Strength is important if your character plans to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Your Strength modifier gets added to melee damage rolls and determines how much your character can carry.

**Dexterity** Dexterity measures your character's agility, balance, and reflexes. Dexterity is important if your character plans to make attacks with ranged weapons or use stealth to surprise foes. Your Dexterity modifier is also added to your character's Armor Class (AC) and Reflex saving throws.

**Constitution** Constitution measures your character's overall health and stamina. Constitution is an important statistic for all characters, especially those who fight in close combat. Your Constitution modifier is added to your Hit Points and Fortitude saving throws.

**Intelligence** Intelligence measures how well your character can learn and reason. A high Intelligence allows your character to analyze situations and understand patterns, and it means they can become trained in additional skills and might be able to master additional languages.

**Wisdom** Wisdom measures your character's common sense, awareness, and intuition. Your Wisdom modifier is added to your Perception and Will saving throws.

**Charisma** Charisma measures your character's personal magnetism and strength of personality. A high Charisma score helps you influence the thoughts and moods of others.

## Starting Ability Scores

Your character's ability scores each start at 10, representing human average, and as you select your ancestry, background, and class, you'll apply ability boosts, which increase a score by 2, and ability flaws, which decrease a score by 2. During character creation, an ability score cannot have more than 4 boosts (a final value of 18). After 1st level, you gain additional ability boosts, see the Leveling Up page for full details.

**Ancestry**: Each ancestry provides ability boosts, and sometimes an ability flaw.

**Background**: Your character's background provides two ability boosts.

**Class**: Your character's class provides an ability boost to the ability score most important to your class, called your key ability score.

**Additional Boosts**: After the other steps, you apply four more ability boosts of your choice.

## Ability Modifier

Once you've finalized your ability scores, you can use them to determine your ability modifiers, which are used in most other statistics in the game.

| Ability Score | Modifier |
| ------------- | -------- |
| 1             | -5       |
| 2 -- 3        | -4       |
| 4 -- 5        | -3       |
| 6 -- 7        | -2       |
| 8 -- 9        | -1       |
| 10 -- 11      | +0       |
| 12 -- 13      | +1       |
| 14 -- 15      | +2       |
| 16 -- 17      | +3       |
| 18 -- 19      | +4       |
| 20 -- 21      | +5       |
| 22 -- 23      | +6       |
| 24 -- 25      | +7       |

# Languages

You know Karrnon, which is the common tongue for adventurers, and a number of additional languages equal to 1 plus your Intelligence modifier.

Not all languages are frequently used, making them harder to learn. You can start knowing one 3rd- or 5th-level language and any languages listed in your culture. All other known languages must be 1st-level.

The full list of languages can be found here.

**Special** Druid start the game knowing Vvark, which is the druidic language. This does not count toward your number of languages.
