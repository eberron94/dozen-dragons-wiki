Primal magic is a form of magic used by druids, shamans, and other primal spellcasters. It taps into the natural world, drawing on the power of animals and plants, the elements, and the spirits of the land. Primal magic focuses on manipulating and transforming the natural world, allowing spellcasters to command the elements, shape the land, and even transform themselves into animals or plants. It also grants spellcasters the ability to commune with nature and commune with spirits.
