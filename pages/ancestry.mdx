# Common Ancestries on Khorvaire

The most common ancestries found on Khorvaire are the following.

## Dwarf

Dwarves are natural miners and smiths, and they control most of the precious metals found naturally across the continent of Khorvaire. Powerful dwarf families mint coinage and operate banks, issue letters of credit, hold loans, and collect debts. Dwarf bankers and merchants wield a great deal of economic power throughout Khorvaire, and they are well respected as a result. To an extent, they are also feared, since dwarves are known to be ruthless in collecting unpaid debts.

Dwarves can manifest the Mark of Warding, bestowing them with powers used to protect people, places, and things from all manner of damage or harm, with a focus on guarding locations and items from would-be thieves. The bloodlines that possess the dragonmark are part of House Kundarak.

## Elf

Many elves are regal and aloof, concerned with plans that cover the sweep of centuries, not the petty day-to-day affairs that occupy the thoughts of other races. A few elves are rather more down-to-earth: The elves of the dragonmarked houses have lived among humans and other short-lived races for centuries and have adjusted their sense of time to accommodate, and the elves of Valenar have rejected many of the old ways of their kind in order to take a more active and expansionist place in the world.

Elves can manifest the Mark of Shadow, granting them various magical benefits that relate to divination and illusions. The bloodlines that possess the dragonmark are part of House Phiarlan or House Thuranni.

## Gnome

Gnomes harbor a thirst for knowledge that can only be described as lust. They believe that every piece of information, no matter how trivial, may someday have value. Combined with a meticulous discipline, this love of knowledge makes gnomes superb librarians, accountants, bards, and alchemists, but this attitude has a sinister side as well. The same talents that make an accomplished bard can produce a skilled spy, and gnome society is filled with webs of intrigue and blackmail that often pass completely unnoticed by human eyes. Like the dwarves, the gnomes have no history of empire building, but their talents for diplomacy and espionage have allowed them to maintain their independence throughout the history of Khorvaire. In addition to their skill as alchemists, gnomes have mastered the art of elemental binding, which they use to power the ships and other vessels they construct in the dry docks and shipyards of Zilargo.

Gnomes can manifest the Mark of Scribing, which bestows a number of powers related to the written word and communication, often over great distances. The bloodlines that possess the dragonmark are part of House Sivis.

## Goblin

The goblinoids are more than tribes of savages scratching at the edges of civilization. They carved out a nation in Khorvaire during the Last War and ruled an empire that spanned the continent. Cunning, fierce, and strong in number, goblinoids are poised to take back the empire that civil war destroyed millennia ago---if they can manage to keep civil war from tearing apart their newborn nation.

## Half-orc

Half-orcs are rare on Khorvaire, since humans and orcs have never lived in particularly close proximity. In the small, scattered human communities of the Shadow Marches, however, half-orcs are more common, and they can also be found in the western parts of the Eldeen Reaches and Droaam. The orcs of the Shadow Marches live much as the humans do: It is a rustic life, to be sure, but a far cry from their existence as ruthless barbarian hordes in the distant past. Half-orcs are just as civilized as the humans of the region, and often look almost human despite their size and strength.

Half-orcs can manifest the Mark of Finding, granting those who bear it abilities related to locating people and objects. The bloodlines that possess the dragonmark are part of House Tharashk.

## Halfling

In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. The heritage of the nomad also serves more urbanized halflings well, and halflings have established themselves across Khorvaire as merchants, politicians, barristers, healers, and criminals. The tribal nomads of the plains can sometimes be found in the cities, but often the halflings of the cities blend in with the rest of the population and display only the occasional reminder of their nomadic roots.

Halflings can manifest the Mark of Healing, granting those who bear it with magic that can cure and aid those in need, or the Mark of Hospitality, bestowing powers related to both food and shelter. The Mark of Healing bloodlines are part of House Ghallanda, while the Mark of Hospitality halflings are part of House Jorasco.

## Human

Humans have inhabited Khorvaire for millennia. They dominate the land, but in some ways they are relative newcomers to the continent. Most humans don't spend time contemplating their race's origins, and many do not even know that they are not native to Khorvaire.

Humans have an abnormally large number of bloodlines that can manifest a dragonmark: Mark of Finding, Mark of Handling, Mark of Making, Mark of Passage, and Mark of Sentinel. Each dragonmark bloodline has unique powers and are part of one of the human run Dragonmark Houses.

## Khoravar

Khoravar, also known as the half-elves, share the continent of Khorvaire with the other common races. When the elves first came to the continent and began mingling with the human settlers, the first half-elves were born. Over time, the half-elves gathered and formed two distinct family groups---the groups that eventually became House Lyrandar and House Medani. For two thousand years, the half-elves of Khorvaire have possessed a culture and society of their own. They came to be known as the khoravar, meaning the children of Khorvaire. Occasionally, elves and humans still produce half-elves, but those belonging to the two khoravar dragonmarked houses breed true as a race of their own.

Khoravar can manifest the Mark of Detection, granting powers of detection and the ability to ferret out danger whether from an ambush or a cup of poisoned wine, and the Mark of Storm, which bestows powers over the weather, from calm winds to raging rainstorms. The Mark of Detection bloodlines are part of House Medani, while the Mark of Storm khoravar are part of House Lyrandar.

# Uncommon Ancestries

A settlement will have fewer of these folks the farther from major cities it is.

## Bugbear

A bugbear is a massive humanoid distantly related to, but larger and stronger than, goblins and hobgoblins. They are one of the only goblinoids to be covered in fur. Like the other goblinoids in Eberron, bugbears were once part of the dominant civilization of Khorvaire thousands of years ago

## Changeling

Changelings are subtle shapeshifters capable of disguising their appearance. They evolved through the union of doppelgangers and humans, eventually becoming a separate race distinct from either ancestral tree. They do not possess the full shapechanging ability of a doppelganger, but they can create effective disguises at will. This ability makes them consummate spies and criminals, and many changelings live up to that potential.

## Hobgoblin

An uncommon variety of goblinoid, the hobgoblin is the middle ground between bugbears and goblins.

Hobgoblins are a race of goblinoids who, along with goblins and bugbears, originated in Khorvaire. They demonstrate a keen artistic and crafting sense and are expert stonemasons and weapon and armorsmiths.

## Kobold

Outsiders often assume that kobolds are primitive and savage since they live in unmodified caverns and rely on oral tradition instead of written records. Also, they live in small tribal communities and have never come together to create cities, nations, or empires. However, kobolds are just as sophisticated as humans or gnomes. While they prefer to live in natural environments instead of creating artificial structures, kobolds have a great gift for mining and stoneworking, and they often fill their lairs with cunning traps. But their culture is driven by tradition, and the kobolds have never sought to change or progress. They are the children of the dragons, vessels of the progenitors' will; change will come when the great dragons mandate it.

## Orc

Wise and wild, the orcs stand out as a race always on the edge of savagery. With a proud history and a sacred duty, orcs are guardians of some of the world's most ancient secrets.

## Shifter

Shifters, sometimes called "the weretouched," are descended from humans and natural lycanthropes, now nearly extinct on Khorvaire. Shifters cannot fully change shape but can take on animalistic features---a state they call shifting. Shifters have evolved into a unique race that breeds true. They have a distinct culture with its own traditions and identity.

## Warforged

Built as mindless machines to fight in the Last War, the warforged developed sentience as a side effect of the arcane experiments that sought to make them the ultimate weapons of destruction. With each successive model that emerged from the creation forges of House Cannith, the warforged evolved until they became a new kind of creatureâ€”living constructs.

# Rare Ancestries

Likely only found only in Sharn or in their homelands.

## Catfolk

Curious and gregarious wanderers, catfolk combine features of felines and humanoids in both appearance and temperament. They enjoy learning new things, collecting new tales and trinkets, and ensuring their loved ones are safe and happy. Catfolk view themselves as chosen guardians of natural places in the world and are often recklessly brave, even in the face of overwhelming opposition.

In Eberron, the catfolk can be found in the Lhazaar Principalities or Xen'Drik. While many see them as shifters, they are in fact a distinct race. Those found in the Lhazaar Principalities are either traders or pirates, while the ones in Xen'Drik live nocturnally in the desert on the north-west part of the continent or in the jungle.

## Dragonborn

The dragonborn came from Argonnessen, the continent of dragons; or that is the prevailing theory, at least. Dragonborn communities have also been spotted in Xen'drik and in Qbarra on Khorvaire, neither of which are willing to give any direct answers on their origins and possible ties to the Dragons of Argonnessen.

## Gnoll

Centuries ago, the gnolls of the Znir Pact turned their backs on the worship of fiends, resolving to live as free people.

## Lizardfolk

Lizardfolk is a name for the collective reptilian tribes that inhabit the jungles of Eberron. Some lizardfolk, like the poison dusk and blackscale tribes, live in the wilds of Q'barra, where they defend their lands from the human colonists of New Galifar and Hope, destroying what they see as the "human infestation."

# Unique Ancestries

Few have seen these ancestries, even in Sharn.

## Automaton

Not all warforged were created during the Last War. Ancient warfogred, called automatons, have been found in stasis in Xen'Drik.

## Fleshwarp

Anguish burns in the eyes of daelkyr half-bloods or fleshwarps, because their spirits are always in conflict. The most obvious outward sign that a creature has been "womb-warped" is the natural symbiont that is first birthed with a fleshwarp (the symbiont is sometimes mistaken for a disfigured twin or gruesome afterbirth), then later befriended, worn, and utilized by the adult half-blood.

## Sprite

Sprites are diminutive, whimsical, and exuberant creatures from the plane of Thelanis, also known as The Faerie Court. They love playing pranks, exploring new things, and embracing everything to do with magic.

# Rare Heritages

> Unlike normal PF2e rules, these heritages are limited to humans. For the purpose of this wiki, each of the heritage pages displays the statistics and ancestry features for humans.

Some humans are born with a strong connection to one of the 13 planes. This extreme influence manifests as a rare heritage, which takes the place of your standard heritage but gives you access to additional ancestry feats.

## Aasimar

Divine magic is usually the product of deep faith and unyielding conviction, but an aasimar has a direct tie to a source of divine power and receives guidance from a celestial entity. Usually, these gifts aren't hereditary, and you can't necessarily identify an aasimar in Eberron by their appearance; there is no single recognized trait that defines an aasimar, and no reliable way of producing one. While the existence of aasimar may seem to fly in the face of Eberron's distant gods, it's important to remember that an aasimar needs no direct connection to a deity. An aasimar draws power from a divine energy source, and their spiritual guide is a celestial being---an angel, a couatl, or similar spirit. The aasimar may be marked as a champion of the faith, but even they can't prove the existence of the Sovereigns.

## Kalashtar

The kalashtar are a compound race: incorporeal entities from the alien plane of Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams, merged with human bodies and spirits to form a distinct species. They were once a minority among the quori, the native race of Dal Quor, hunted and persecuted for their religious beliefs. Thousands of years after the quori invaded Eberron and the connection between their plane and the Material Plane was severed, the kalashtar were the first of the quori to discover a means to reach the Material Plane once more. Fleeing persecution, they transformed their physical forms into psychic projections that allowed them to enter the Material Plane and possess willing humans. Today, new kalashtar are born, not possessed; neither spirit nor human, they are a new race that breeds true.

## Tieflings

Believed to be the result of infernal dealings or exposure to infernal energies from a manifest zone during birth, the tieflings within the Five Nations are feared and rejected by most.
