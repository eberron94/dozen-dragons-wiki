A witch's knowledge from their patron comes in the form of lessons, which you can learn from the First Lesson class feature or by selecting feats like Basic Lesson. Each lesson grants you a hex and teaches your familiar a new spell, adding it to the spells you can prepare using your witch spellcasting. You gain this spell even if it's not on your tradition's spell list.
