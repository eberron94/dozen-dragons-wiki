_You are an eternal student of the arcane secrets of the universe, using your mastery of magic to cast powerful and devastating spells. You treat magic like a science, cross-referencing the latest texts on practical spellcraft with ancient esoteric tomes to discover and understand how magic works. Yet magical theory is vast, and there's no way you can study it all. You either specialize in one of the eight schools of magic, gaining deeper understanding of the nuances of those spells above all others, or favor a broader approach that emphasizes the way all magic comes together at the expense of depth._

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Intelligence

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Intelligence.

**Hit Points** 6 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see the following term in many wizard class features.

**Metamagic** These actions tweak your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action.

## In Combat

You likely try to stay out of the fray, carefully judging when to use your spells. You save your most powerful magic to incapacitate threatening foes and use your cantrips when only weaker foes remain. When enemies pull out tricks like invisibility or flight, you answer with spells like glitterdust or earth bind, leveling the field for your allies.

# Proficiencies

You are trained in Arcana and a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier.

**+** When you roll a success with this save, you get a critical success instead.

# Class Features

As a wizard, you gain the following class feature and sub-class features at the listed level. Additionally, at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a wizard class feat.

{{{featureClass "Arcane Prepared Spellcasting" level=1}}}

Through dedicated study and practice, you can harness arcane power to cast spells. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells).

Each day, you can prepare a number of spells and cantrips each morning from spells in your spellbook. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase.

Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls.

| Level | Cantrips | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th |
| ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |

| 16    | 5        | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | —   | —    |
| 17    | 5        | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | —    |

| 20    | 5        | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 1^†^ |

**†** The archwizard's spellcraft class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.

#### Heightening Spells

When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.

#### Cantrips

Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.

{{{featureClass "Spellbook" level=1}}}

Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like The Crimson Libram, or something more academic, like A Field Study in Practical Transmutation.

Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level for which you have spell slots. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures (See Learn a Spell).

{{{featureClass "Arcane Thesis" level=1}}}

During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a variety of topics. You gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like "On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic.""

Arcane theses can be found below.

{{{featureClass "Arcane School (Focus Spell)" level=1}}}

Many arcane spellcasters delve deeply into a single school of magic in an attempt to master its secrets. If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school, as well as a school spell.

School spells are a special type of spell taught to students of your arcane school. School spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to study your spellbook or perform arcane research.

If you don't choose a school, you're a universalist, a wizard who believes that the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater flexibility. You do not learn a school spell, but can gain universalist spells as a wizard feat, which are also a type of focus spell.

Arcane schools can be found on the Schools page, found [here](/class/wizard/schools).

{{{featureClass "Arcane Bond" level=1}}}

You place some of your magical power in a bonded item. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=13}}}

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Resolve" level=17}}}

You've steeled your mind with resolve. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Archwizard's Spellcraft" level=19}}}

You command the most potent arcane magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using arcane spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. Unlike with other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the Archwizard's Might feat to gain a second slot.

# Thesis [Sub Class]

During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a variety of topics. You gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like "On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic."

## Improved Familiar Attunement

You've long held that fine-tuning the magic that bonds wizard and familiar can improve the mystic connection, compared to the safe yet generic bond most wizards currently use. You've formed such a pact with your familiar, gaining more advantages from it than most wizards. You gain the Familiar wizard feat. Your familiar has extra familiar ability slots, and gains more as you increase your level. Your connection with your familiar alters your arcane bond class feature so that you store your magical energy in your familiar, rather than an item you own; you also gain the Drain Familiar free action instead of Drain Bonded Item. Drain Familiar can be used any time an ability would allow you to use Drain Bonded Item and functions identically, except that you draw magic from your familiar instead of an item.

| Familiar  | 1st level | 6th level | 12th level | 18th level |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Abilities | 3         | 4         | 5          | 6          |

## Metamagical Experimentation

You've realized that the practice known as metamagic is a holdover from a time long ago, when wizards had to work out their own spells and variations rather than rely on spells recorded by others and passed down over the years. This allows you efficient access to various metamagic effects.

You gain one 1st-level metamagic wizard feat of your choice.

{{{featureClass "Additional Experimentation" level=4 altered=true}}}

During your daily preparations, you can gain a metamagic wizard feat or metamagic sorcerer feat of your choice that has a level requirement of no more than half your level, which you can use until your next daily preparations.

{{{featureClass "Advanced Experimentation" level=12 altered=true}}}

During your daily preparations, you can choose two metamagic feats, instead of one, which you can use until your next daily preparations.

## Spell Blending

You theorize that spell slots are a shorthand for an underlying energy that powers all spellcasting, and you've found a way to tinker with the hierarchy of spell slots, combining them to fuel more powerful spells.

When you make your daily preparations, you can trade two spell slots of the same level for a bonus spell slot of up to 2 levels higher than the traded spell slots. You can exchange as many spell slots as you have available. Bonus spell slots must be of a level you can normally cast, and each bonus spell slot must be of a different spell level. You can also trade any spell slot for two additional cantrips, though you cannot trade more than one spell slot at a time for additional cantrips in this way.

## Spell Substitution

You don't accept the fact that once spells are prepared, they can't be changed until your next daily preparation, and you have uncovered a shortcut allowing you to substitute new spells for those you originally prepared.

You can spend 10 minutes to empty one of your prepared spell slots and prepare a different spell from your spellbook in its place. If you are interrupted during such a swap, the original spell remains prepared and can still be cast. You can try again to swap out the spell later, but you must start the process over again.

## Staff Nexus

Your thesis maintains that early and intense adoption of staves from the first days of study can create a symbiotic bond between spellcaster and staff, allowing them to create remarkable magic together. You've formed such a connection with a makeshift staff you built, and you are ready to infuse any staff you encounter with greater power.

You begin play with a makeshift staff of your own invention. It contains one cantrip and one 1st-level spell, both from your spellbook, but it gains no charges normally during your preparations; you must expend a spell slot to grant it charges in the same way you would add additional charges to a normal staff. You can Craft your makeshift staff into any other type of staff for the new staff's usual cost, adding the two spells you originally chose to the staff you Craft.

{{{featureClass "Advanced Nexus" level=8}}}

You can expend two spells instead of one when preparing your staff, adding additional charges equal to the combined levels of the expended spells.

{{{featureClass "Major Nexus" level=8}}}

You can expend up to a total of three spells to add charges to the staff, adding additional charges equal to the combined levels of all three spells.
