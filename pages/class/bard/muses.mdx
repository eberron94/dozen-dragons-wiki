# Polymath

Your muse is a jack of all trades, flitting between skills and pursuits. If it's is a creature, it might be an eclectic creature like a fey; if a deity, it might be Boldrei. As a bard with a polymath muse, you are interested in a wide array of topics but rarely dedicated to any one, and you rarely make up your mindâ€”you want to try everything. You gain the Versatile Performance feat and add unseen servant to your spell repertoire.

# Warrior

The battlefield is your stage, the clang of steel, your song. Your muse engages in countless battles, whether reveling in combat or resigned to its necessity. If your muse is a creature, it might be an otherworldly soldier. If it's a deity, it might be Dol Dorn or the Lord of Blades. As a bard with a warrior muse, you train for battle in addition to performance, and you prepare your allies for the dangers of battle. You might even wade into the thick of things with them. You gain the Martial Performance feat and add fear to your spell repertoire.
