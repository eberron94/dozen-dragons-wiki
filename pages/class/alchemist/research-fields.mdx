Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formula book; these are your signature items. When using a batch of infused reagents to create your signature items using advanced alchemy, you create three items instead of two. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research field's list of possible signature items.

# Bomber

You specialize in explosions and other violent alchemical reactions.

{{{featureClass "Research Field" level=1 id="bomber" altered=true}}}

You start with the formulas for two 1st-level alchemical bombs in your formula book, in addition to your other formulas.

When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, you can deal splash damage to only your primary target instead of the usual splash area.

{{{featureClass "Field Discovery" level=5 id="bomber"}}}

When using advanced alchemy to make bombs during your daily preparations, you can use a batch of reagents to create any three bombs instead of just two of the same bomb.

{{{featureClass "Perpetual Infusions" level=7 id="bomber"}}}

You have learned how to create perpetual alchemical infusions that can provide a near-infinite supply of certain simple items. Choose two 1st-level alchemical bombs from your formula book. You gain the ability to create the chosen items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents. Each time you gain a level, you can swap any number of your perpetual infusions with other eligible infusions.

{{{featureClass "Perpetual Potency" level=11 id="bomber"}}}

Your perpetual infusions improve. Choose two 3rd-level or lower alchemical bombs from your formula book. You gain the ability to create the chosen items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents.

{{{featureClass "Greater Field Discovery" level=13 id="bomber"}}}

You can increase the splash on your bombs to damage creatures within 10 feet, or 15 feet if you have Expanded Splash.

{{{featureClass "Perpetual Perfection" level=17 id="bomber"}}}

You have perfected your perpetual infusions. Choose two 11th-level or lower alchemical bombs from your formula book. You gain the ability to create the chosen items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents.

# Chirurgeon

You concentrate on healing others with alchemy.

{{{featureClass "Research Field" level=1 id="chirurgeon" altered=true}}}

You start with the formulas for two common 1st-level elixirs with the healing trait in your formula book, in addition to your other formulas.

You can use your proficiency rank in Crafting for anything that requires a proficiency rank in Medicine (such as prerequisites), and use your Crafting modifier in place of your Medicine modifier for all Medicine checks."

{{{featureClass "Field Discovery" level=5 id="chirurgeon"}}}

When using advanced alchemy to make elixirs with the healing trait during your daily preparations, you can create three elixirs with each batch of reagents instead of two.

{{{featureClass "Perpetual Infusions" level=7 id="chirurgeon"}}}

You have learned how to create perpetual alchemical infusions that can provide a near-infinite supply of certain simple items. Choose two 1st-level elixirs with the healing trait from your formula book. You gain the ability to create the chosen items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents. If a creature heals Hit Points from a perpetual infusion, that creature is temporarily immune to healing Hit Points from subsequent perpetual infusions for 10 minutes (but not immune to any other effects of those infusions). Each time you gain a level, you can swap any number of your perpetual infusions with other eligible infusions.

{{{featureClass "Perpetual Potency" level=11 id="chirurgeon"}}}

Your perpetual infusions improve. Choose two 6th-level or lower elixirs with the healing trait from your formula book. You gain the ability to create the chosen items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents.

{{{featureClass "Greater Field Discovery" level=13 id="chirurgeon"}}}

When you use Quick Alchemy to create any type of elixir of life, the creature drinking the elixir gains the maximum Hit Points possible for that elixir, instead of rolling to determine the number of Hit Points regained.

{{{featureClass "Perpetual Perfection" level=17 id="chirurgeon"}}}

You have perfected your perpetual infusions. Choose two 11th-level or lower elixirs with the healing trait from your formula book. You gain the ability to create the chosen items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents.

# Mutagenist

You focus on bizarre mutagenic transformations that sacrifice one aspect of a creature's physical or psychological being in order to strengthen another.

{{{featureClass "Research Field" level=1 id="mutagenist" altered=true}}}

You start with the formulas for two 1st-level mutagens in your formula book, in addition to your other formulas.

You gain the Mutagenic Flashback action.

{{{card "action.class.alchemist.subclass.mutagenist.crb.mutagenic-flashback"}}}

{{{featureClass "Field Discovery" level=5 id="mutagenist"}}}

When using advanced alchemy to make mutagens during your daily preparations, you can use a batch of reagents to create any three mutagens instead of just two of the same mutagen.

{{{featureClass "Perpetual Infusions" level=7 id="mutagenist"}}}

You have learned how to create perpetual alchemical infusions that can provide a near-infinite supply of certain simple items. Choose two 1st-level mutagens from your formula book. You gain the ability to create the chosen items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents. Each time you gain a level, you can swap any number of your perpetual infusions with other eligible infusions.

{{{featureClass "Perpetual Potency" level=11 id="mutagenist"}}}

Your perpetual infusions improve. Choose two 3rd-level or lower mutagens from your formula book. You gain the ability to create the chosen items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents.

{{{featureClass "Greater Field Discovery" level=13 id="mutagenist" altered=true}}}

You ignore the drawbacks of mutagens you imbibe.

<!-- If you imbibe another mutagen while you are under the effects of a mutagen that you created, you can gain the benefits and the drawbacks of both mutagens at once, despite the fact that they both have the polymorph trait and would not normally function together. If you come under the effects of any further mutagens while benefiting from two mutagens, you lose the benefit of one of the former mutagens of your choice, while retaining the drawbacks of all the mutagens. If you are under the effects of two mutagens and you come under the effect of a non-mutagen polymorph effect, you lose the benefits of the mutagens while retaining the drawbacks of both. -->

{{{featureClass "Perpetual Perfection" level=17 id="mutagenist"}}}

You have perfected your perpetual infusions. Choose two 11th-level or lower mutagens from your formula book. You gain the ability to create the chosen items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents.

# Toxicologist

You specialize in toxins and venoms of all types.

{{{featureClass "Research Field" level=1 id="toxicologist" altered=true}}}

You start with the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical poisons in your formula book, in addition to your other formulas.

You can apply an injury poison you're holding to a weapon you're wielding as a single action, rather than as a 2-action activity, and you can change the DCs of your infused poisons to your class DC if it's higher.

{{{featureClass "Field Discovery" level=5 id="toxicologist"}}}

When using advanced alchemy to make poisons during your daily preparations, you can spend one batch of reagents to create three poisons in any combination, instead of just two of the same poison.

{{{featureClass "Perpetual Infusions" level=7 id="toxicologist"}}}

You have learned how to create perpetual alchemical infusions that can provide a near-infinite supply of certain simple items. Choose two common 1st-level poisons from your formula book. You gain the ability to create the chosen items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents. Each time you gain a level, you can swap any number of your perpetual infusions with other eligible infusions.

{{{featureClass "Perpetual Potency" level=11 id="toxicologist"}}}

Your perpetual infusions improve. Choose two common 5th-level or lower alchemical poisons from your formula book. You gain the ability to create the chosen items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents.

{{{featureClass "Greater Field Discovery" level=13 id="toxicologist"}}}

You can apply two different injury poisons to the same weapon, though not to a piece of ammunition. The two poisons can be up to six levels lower than your level, and you can't use the poisons made without spending a batch of infused reagents via perpetual infusions. Applying the two poisons requires a separate action to apply each poison. Once completed, you combine the two poisons on the weapon into a double poison with the lower of the two poisons' DCs. This double poison is only virulent if both poisons were virulent, and if the poisons have a different number of stages, the double poison has a number of stages equal to the poison with the lower number of stages. The target takes the effects of both poisons for its current stage.

{{{featureClass "Perpetual Perfection" level=17 id="toxicologist"}}}

You have perfected your perpetual infusions. Choose two common 11th-level or lower poisons from your formula book. You gain the ability to create the chosen items using Quick Alchemy without spending a batch of infused reagents.
