_You are an emissary of a deity, a devoted servant who has taken up a weighty mantle, and you adhere to a code that holds you apart from those around you. While champions exist for every alignment, as a champion of good, you provide certainty and hope to the innocent. You have powerful defenses that you share freely with your allies and innocent bystanders, as well as holy power you use to end the threat of evil. Your devotion even attracts the attention of holy spirits who aid you on your journey._

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Strength or Dexterity

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.

**Hit Points** 10 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see these terms in many champion abilities.

**Flourish** Flourishes are techniques that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Metamagic** These actions tweak your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action.

**Oath** Oaths add an additional tenet to your code. You can usually have only one feat with this trait.

## In Combat

You confront enemies in hand-to-hand combat while carefully positioning yourself to protect your allies.

# Proficiencies

You are trained in Religion, a skill determined by your deity, and a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier.

# Class Features

As a champion, you gain the following class feature and sub-class features at the listed level. Additionally, at 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a champion class feat.

{{{featureClass "Code of the Champion and Abhorrent Actions" level=1 altered=true}}}

You follow a code of conduct, beginning with tenets shared by a religious organization, and continuing with tenets of your cause. Tenets are listed in order of importance, starting with the most important. If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren't in a no-win situation; instead, follow the more important tenet. For instance, as a paladin, if an evil king asked you if you're hiding refugees so he could execute them, you could lie to him, since the tenet against lying is less important than preventing harm to innocents. Trying to subvert your code by creating a situation that forces a higher tenet to override a lower tenet (for example, promising not to respect authorities and then, to keep your word, disrespecting authorities) is a violation of the champion code.

Acts fundamentally opposed by your religion's ideals are abhorrent to them. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are abhorrent to them can remove you from their good graces, if they find out.

Violating the ideals and goals of the church might risk punishment, but a corrupt faction within it will hide the abhorrent actions. In the case of being caught, churches like the Silver Flame and the Sovereign Host will have a cleric perform a ceremonial version of the Atone ritual as a way to determine if the individual is penitent or not. Instead of losing or gaining divine abilities, the result is interpreted by a superior and only effects the political standing of the atoning individual.

Below are some example tenets.

**Tenets for Good** Any good champion can use these tenets.

-   You must never perform acts anathema to your deity or willingly commit an evil act, such as murder, torture, or the casting of an evil spell.

-   You must never knowingly harm an innocent, or allow immediate harm to one through inaction when you know you could reasonably prevent it. This tenet doesn't force you to take action against possible harm to innocents at an indefinite time in the future, or to sacrifice your life to protect them.

**Tenets for Purification** A champion of the Church of the Silver Flame can use these tenets.

-   Eradicate alien evil. Fiends and aberrations are malevolent and foreign.
-   Eradicate unnatural evil. Undead and lycanthropes are corrupted by malevolent forces.
-   Eradicate innate evil. Individuals that commit evil actions spread the malevolence.
-   Eradicate the evil within. Stay vigilant against the whispers.

{{{featureClass "Cause and Anathema" level=1 altered=true}}}

Champions are divine servants of a cause, usually defined by a religious organization. Choose a cause to follow. Your cause determines your champion's reaction, grants you a devotion spell, and defines part of your champion's code.

Actions fundamentally opposed to your cause's ideals are anathema to your faith. You and your GM determine whether other acts are anathema. If you violate your cause, you lose your focus pool and divine ally until you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual, but you keep any other champion abilities that don't require those class features.

{{{featureClass "Deific Weapon" level=1}}}

You zealously bear your deity's favored weapon. If it's uncommon, you gain access to it. If it's an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).

{{{featureClass "Devotion Spells (Focus Spells)" level=1}}}

Your faith grants you special divine spells called devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules are found here. You gain a devotion spell depending on your cause. Your spellcasting ability is Charisma.

{{{featureClass "Shield Block" level=1}}}

You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.

{{{featureClass "Divine Ally" level=3}}}

Your devotion attracts a spirit of your cause's alignment. Once you choose an ally, your choice can't be changed.

The following are divine allies:

**Blade Ally** A spirit of battle dwells within your armaments. Select one weapon or handwraps of mighty blows when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the item gains the effect of a property rune and you also gain the weapon's critical specialization effect. For a champion following the tenets of good, choose disrupting, ghost touch, returning, or shifting. For a champion following the tenets of evil, choose fearsome, returning, or shifting.

**Shield Ally** A spirit of protection dwells within your shield. In your hands, the shield's Hardness increases by 2 and its HP and BT increase by half.

**Steed Ally** You gain a young animal companion as a mount. Ordinarily, your animal companion is one that has the mount special ability, such as a horse. You can select a different animal companion (GM's discretion), but this ability doesn't grant it the mount special ability.

{{{featureClass "Armor Specialization" level=7}}}

You have spent so much time in armor that you know how to make the most of its protection. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=7}}}

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Juggernaut" level=9}}}

Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Divine Will" level=11}}}

Your faith grants mastery of your will. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Greater Weapon Specialization" level=15}}}

The weapons you've mastered become truly fearsome in your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Heroic Defiance" level=19}}}

You can defy fate and continue fighting as long as you have divine energy. You gain the hero's defiance devotion spell.

# Cause [Sub Class]

You have one of the following causes. Your cause must match your alignment exactly. Your cause determines your champion's reaction, grants you a devotion spell, and defines part of your champion's code.

## Paladin [Lawful Good]

You're honorable, forthright, and committed to pushing back the forces of cruelty. You gain the Retributive Strike champion's reaction and the lay on hands devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these tenets:

-   You must act with honor, never taking advantage of others, lying, or cheating.
-   You must respect the lawful authority of legitimate leadership wherever you go, and follow its laws.

{{{featureClass "Champion Reaction" level=1 id='paladin'}}}

You gain the Retributive Strike reaction.

{{{featureClass "Divine Smite" level=9 id='paladin'}}}

You surround evil targets in a punishing halo. If you hit with your Retributive Strike, the target takes persistent good damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

{{{featureClass "Exalt" level=9 id='paladin'}}}

When you use Retributive Strike, each ally within 15 feet of you with the target in their melee reach can spend a reaction to Strike the target with a -5 penalty.

## Redeemer [Neutral Good]

You're full of kindness and forgiveness. You gain the Glimpse of Redemption champion's reaction and the lay on hands devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these:

-   You must first try to redeem those who commit evil acts, rather than killing them or meting out punishment. If they then continue on a wicked path, you might need to take more extreme measures.
-   You must show compassion for others, regardless of their authority or station.

{{{featureClass "Champion Reaction" level=1 id='Redeemer'}}}

You gain the Glimpse of Redemption reaction.

{{{featureClass "Divine Smite" level=9 id='Redeemer'}}}

A guilty conscience assails foes who spurn your Glimpse of Redemption. A foe that responds to your Glimpse of Redemption by dealing damage takes persistent good damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

{{{featureClass "Exalt" level=9 id='Redeemer'}}}

You protect multiple allies. You can apply the resistance granted by Glimpse of Redemption to yourself and all allies within 15 feet of you, including the triggering ally, except the resistance is reduced by 2 for all.

## Liberator [Chaotic Good]

You're committed to defending the freedom of others. You gain the Liberating Step champion's reaction and the lay on hands devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these tenets:

-   You must respect the choices others make over their own lives, and you can't force someone to act in a particular way or threaten them if they don't.
-   You must demand and fight for others' freedom to make their own decisions. You may never engage in or countenance slavery or tyranny.

{{{featureClass "Champion Reaction" level=1 id='Liberator'}}}

You gain the Liberating Step reaction.

{{{featureClass "Divine Smite" level=9 id='Liberator'}}}

You punish those who ensnare your allies in bondage. If the triggering enemy was using any effects to make your ally grabbed, restrained, immobilized, or paralyzed when you used Liberating Step, that enemy takes persistent good damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

{{{featureClass "Exalt" level=9 id='Liberator'}}}

You can help your whole group get into position. When you use Liberating Step, if your ally doesn't attempt to break free of an effect, you and all allies within 15 feet can Step, in addition to the triggering ally.
