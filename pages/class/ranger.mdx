_Some rangers believe civilization wears down the soul, but still needs to be protected from wild creatures. Others say nature needs to be protected from the greedy, who wish to tame its beauty and plunder its treasures. You could champion either goal, or both. You might be a scout, tracker, or hunter of fugitives or beasts, haunting the edge of civilization or exploring the wilds. You know how to live off the land and are skilled at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies._

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Strength or Dexterity

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.

**Hit Points** 10 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see these key terms in many ranger class features.

**Flourish** Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Open** These maneuvers work only as the first salvo in the attacks you make on your turn. You can use an action with the open trait only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.

**Press** Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.

Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)

## In Combat

You can single out particular foes to hunt, making you better at defeating them. You target and brutalize your chosen foe with either a bow or melee weapons, while supporting your allies with your skills.

# Proficiencies

You are trained in Nature, Survival, and a number of additional skills equal to 4 plus your Intelligence modifier.

# Class Features

As a ranger, you gain the following class feature at the listed level. Additionally, at 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a ranger class feat.

{{{featureClass "Hunt Prey" level=1}}}

When you focus your attention on a single foe, you become unstoppable in your pursuit. You gain the Hunt Prey action.

{{{featureClass "Hunter's edges" level=1}}}

You have trained for countless hours to become a more skilled hunter and tracker, gaining an additional benefit when you Hunt Prey depending on the focus of your training. Choose a hunter's edge.

Hunter's edges can be found below.

{{{featureClass "Warden Spells" level=1}}}

**Special** This class feature is only granted when you gain a ranger feat that grants a warden spell.

Your relationship with the world around you extends from the physical to the magical. Certain feats grant you warden spells, which are a type of focus spells. It costs 1 Focus Point (FP) to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first warden spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 FP. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 FP by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with nature.

Your warden spells are primal spells. When you first gain a warden spell, you become trained in primal spell attacks and spell DCs. Your spellcasting ability is Wisdom.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 FP. The full rules for focus spells appear here.

{{{featureClass "Critical Prey" level=5}}}

You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks when attacking your hunted prey.

{{{featureClass "Trackless Step" level=5}}}

When you move through natural terrains, you are difficult to track. You always gain the benefits of the Cover Tracks action in such terrains, without moving at half your Speed.

{{{featureClass "Evasion" level=7}}}

You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=7}}}

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Nature's Edge" level=9}}}

You always find the weak points in your foes' defenses when they're on unfavorable terrain. Enemies are flat-footed to you if they're in natural difficult terrain or in difficult terrain resulting from a snare.

{{{featureClass "Juggernaut" level=11}}}

Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Wild Stride" level=11}}}

You move quickly through obstacles, whether they're tumbled stone, tangled undergrowth, or sucking mud. You can ignore the effects of non-magical difficult terrain. As normal for ignoring difficult terrain, this also lets you treat the hindrances of greater difficult terrain as those of difficult terrain.

{{{featureClass "Greater Weapon Specialization" level=15}}}

The weapons you've mastered become truly fearsome in your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Improved Evasion" level=15}}}

Your ability to elude danger is matchless. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.

{{{featureClass "Masterful Hunt" level=17}}}

You have honed your abilities as a hunter to incredible levels. When using a ranged weapon that you have master proficiency in, you can ignore the penalty if attacking your hunted prey within the weapon's second and third range increments.

You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when you Seek your prey. If you have master proficiency in Survival, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Survival checks when you Track your prey.

{{{featureClass "Second Skin" level=19}}}

Your armor has become akin to a second skin for you. When wearing light or medium armor, you can rest normally, rather than receiving poor rest that leaves you fatigued.

{{{featureClass "Swift Prey" level=19}}}

You size up your prey with only a glance. You can use Hunt Prey as a free action if it's your first action of your turn.

# Edge [Sub Class]

You have trained for countless hours to become a more skilled hunter and tracker, gaining an additional benefit when you Hunt Prey depending on the focus of your training.

## Flurry

You have trained to unleash a devastating flurry of attacks upon your prey. Your multiple attack penalty for attacks against your hunted prey is -3 (-2 with an agile weapon) on your second attack of the turn instead of -5, and -6 (-4 with an agile weapon) on your third or subsequent attack of the turn, instead of -10.

{{{featureClass "Masterful Hunter Upgrade" level=17 id="flurry"}}}

You can blend your weapon mastery with skillful targeting to make a series of precise attacks. If you have master proficiency with your weapon, your multiple attack penalty for attacks against your hunted prey is -2 (-1 with an agile weapon) on your second attack of the turn, and -4 (-2 with an agile weapon) on your third and subsequent attacks of the turn.

## Outwit

You are talented at outwitting and evading your prey. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks, Intimidation checks, Stealth checks, and any checks to Recall Knowledge about the prey, and a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against your prey's attacks.

{{{featureClass "Masterful Hunter Upgrade" level=17 id="Outwit"}}}

Your mastery of skills allows you to overwhelm your prey. If you have master proficiency in Deception, Intimidation, Stealth, or the skill you use to Recall Knowledge about your prey, increase the circumstance bonus against the prey with that skill from +2 to +4. If you have master proficiency with your armor, increase the circumstance bonus to AC against the prey from +1 to +2.

## Precision

You have trained to aim for your prey's weak points. The first time you hit your hunted prey in a round, you also deal 1d8 additional precision damage. (Precision damage increases the damage you already deal, using the same type, but is ineffective against creatures that lack vital organs or weak points.) At 11th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8 precision damage, and at 19th level, the extra damage increases to 3d8 precision damage.

{{{featureClass "Masterful Hunter Upgrade" level=17 id="Precision"}}}

Your weapon mastery allows you to hit your prey's vital areas multiple times. The second time in a round you hit your hunted prey, you also deal 1d8 precision damage. At 19th level, your second hit in a round against your hunted prey deals 2d8 precision damage, and your third hit in a round against your hunted prey deals 1d8 precision damage.
