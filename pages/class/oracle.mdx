_Your conduit to divine power eschews the traditional channels of prayer and servitude—you instead glean divine truths that extend beyond any single deity. You understand the great mysteries of the universe embodied in overarching concepts that transcend good and evil or chaos and law, whether because you perceive the common ground across multiple deities or circumvent their power entirely. You explore one of these mysteries and draw upon its power to cast miraculous spells, but that power comes with a terrible price: a curse that grows stronger the more you draw upon it. Your abilities are a double-edged sword, which you might uphold as an instrument of the divine or view as a curse from the gods._

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Charisma

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your Charisma.

**Hit Points** 8 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see these key terms in many oracle class features.

**Cursebound** Spells with this trait increase the severity of your oracular curse when cast. Usually only revelation spells have this trait. You can't cast a cursebound spell if you don't have an oracular curse.

**Fortune and Misfortune** Fortune and misfortune effects can alter how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune and one misfortune effect come into play on a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you must pick which to use. If two misfortune effects apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If both a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

**Metamagic** Actions with the metamagic trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself.

## In Combat

You draw upon your mystery to empower yourself in combat, balancing miraculous effects with the increasing severity of your curse as conflicting divine demands overtax your physical body. You cast spells to aid your allies and devastate your foes, or depending on your mystery, you might wade into battle yourself.

# Proficiencies

You are trained in Religion, a skill determined by your mystery, and a number of additional skills equal to 3 plus your Intelligence modifier.

## Class DC & Attacks

**+** When you roll a success with this save, you get a critical success instead.

**++** When you roll a critical failure with this save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure with this save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.

# Class Features

As an oracle, you gain the following class features at the listed level. Additionally, at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an oracle class feat.

{{{featureClass "Mystery" level=1}}}

An oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine being. This power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle's mystery, a source of divine magic not beholden to any deity.

Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your mystery grants you special spells called revelation spells and might later grant you divine domain spells. It dictates the effects of your oracular curse, adds an additional cantrip to your repertoire, and gives you one or more trained skills. Drawing insight and power from the collective divine influences that fuel your magic also provides you with a special benefit.

The list of oracle mysteries can be found below.

{{{featureClass "Divine Spontaneous Spellcasting" level=1}}}

Your mystery provides you with divine magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Your unconventional access to this divine power means you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a material component pouch when casting spells.

Each day, you can cast a number of spells determined by your level. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the Spell Repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.

Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.

| Level | Cantrips | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th |
| ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |

**†** The oracular clarity class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works differently from other spell slots.

#### Heightening Spells

When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. To cast a heightened spell, you must have the heightened version in your repertoire; for example, you can't cast a 3rd-level version of a spell that is only in your repertoire at 1st level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.

#### Cantrips

Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of oracle spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.

{{{featureClass "Spell Repertoire" level=1}}}

The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the divine spell list, or from other divine spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.

You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot, you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.

Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.

#### Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire

As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.

{{{featureClass "Revelation Spells (Focus Spells)" level=1}}}

The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells, which are a type of focus spell. Casting a revelation spell costs 1 Focus Point and increases the effects of your oracular curse. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to reconcile the conflicting or unconventional nature of your divine mystery.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots (see Divine Spellcasting). Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear here.

Revelation spells have the cursebound trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means they increase the severity of your oracular curse (see below) when cast. You can't cast a cursebound spell if you don't have an oracular curse.

You learn two revelation spells at 1st level. The first is an initial revelation spell determined by your mystery. The second is an initial domain spell you select from one of the domains associated with your mystery, which you cast as a revelation spell, causing it to gain the cursebound trait.

{{{featureClass "Oracular Curse (Focus Spells)" level=1}}}

Drawing on multiple disparate sources of power inevitably places an incredible stress on your body, manifesting as a supernatural curse. The more revelation spells you cast, the worse the effects of your curse, but these increasingly conflicting energies can also provide you with divine benefits.

The specific effects of your curse are tied to your mystery, but all curses follow the same progression. A curse continually gives you a mild but constant reminder that you carry otherworldly power. As you cast revelation spells, your curse intensifies, first to a minor effect and then to a moderate effect.

Your curse progresses to its minor stage the first time you finish casting a revelation spell after your daily preparations. Once your minor curse has manifested, it remains in effect until you rest for 8 hours and again make your daily preparations. If you cast a revelation spell while your minor curse is in effect, you progress to the moderate curse effect immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. The minor effect continues to affect you, though some moderate curse effects might alter the specifics of your minor curse. At higher levels, you can cast more revelation spells, progressing your curse to its major stage and then an extreme stage; these stronger curses are cumulative with the effects of the lower stages and can alter them. When you Refocus while under the effects of your moderate or stronger curse, you reduce your curse's severity to minor in addition to regaining a Focus Point.

Drawing upon your mystery's power while your curse is at its worst causes an irreconcilable conflict between you and the sources of your power. Immediately after casting a revelation spell while under the moderate effect of your curse, you are overwhelmed. While overwhelmed, you can't Cast or Sustain any revelation spells— you effectively lose access to those spells. You can still Refocus to reduce the effects of your curse and regain a Focus Point, but doing so doesn't allow you to cast further revelation spells. These effects last until you rest for 8 hours and make your daily preparations, at which point your curse returns to its basic state. At higher levels, you can grow to withstand your curse's major and even extreme effects, enabling you to cast more revelation spells without becoming overwhelmed.

Your curse has the curse, divine, and necromancy traits. You can't mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your oracular curse by any means other than Refocusing and resting for 8 hours. For example, if your curse makes creatures concealed from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as true strike (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, remove curse and similar spells don't affect your curse at all.

{{{featureClass "Signature Spells" level=3}}}

Experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell level or lower). You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.

{{{featureClass "Resolve" level=9}}}

You've steeled your mind with resolve. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Major Curse" level=11}}}

You've learned to better balance the conflicting powers wreaking havoc on your body. Immediately after completing the casting of a revelation spell while you are affected by your moderate curse, your curse progresses to its major effect, rather than overwhelming you. This effect lasts until you Refocus, which reduces your curse to its minor effect. If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of your major curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse.

In addition, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool from 2 to 3. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=13}}}

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Extreme Curse" level=17}}}

You have mastered a perilous balance between the conflicting divine powers of your mystery, gaining the power to change your fate, but straining both body and soul. When you cast a revelation spell while affected by your major curse, your curse intensifies to an extreme effect instead of overwhelming you. All mysteries share the same effects for their extreme curse.

When affected by your extreme curse, you become doomed 2 (or increase your doomed condition by 2 if you were already doomed). Once every 10 minutes, when you fail an attack roll, skill or Perception check, or saving throw, you can reroll it and use the second result. The reroll has the fortune trait and doesn't require you to spend an action, meaning you can use the reroll even if you can't act. These effects are in addition to all the effects of your major curse, and they can't be removed by any means until you Refocus to reduce your curse to its minor effect.

If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of this extreme curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse, and you remain doomed 2 even if you Refocus. Additionally, if you spend at least 3 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.

{{{featureClass "Greater Resolve" level=17}}}

Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.

{{{featureClass "Oracular Clarity" level=19}}}

You now fully grasp the nature of the divine power behind your mystery, allowing you to work magic akin to miracles. Add two common 10th-level divine spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the Oracular Providence feat to gain a second slot.

# Mystery [Sub Class]

Choose the divine mystery that fuels your mystical power. Your mystery might represent a pantheistic devotion to all the deities with power over the subject of your mystery, veneration of a particular ideal, or a conduit to raw divine energy. Whatever its origin and nature, your mystery determines the revelation spells you can cast and the oracular curse that overtakes your body when you do.

## Ancestor

The voices of generations past speak to you, and you hear their words. You might resent the constant interruption, or you might revere the spirits of those who came before. You learn from their whispers and the fragments of their memories, but opening your mind to their knowledge and experience also allows them to meddle in your worldly affairs.

The whispers of your ancestors have bestowed additional knowledge upon you.

-   You gain an additional ancestry feat at 1st level and another additional ancestry feat at 11th level (these feats can't be ones that grant physiological effects, such as additional senses or unarmed attacks)
-   You are trained in Society
-   You gain the guidance cantrip
-   You gain the ancestral touch revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Divine Domain Revelation" level=1 id='ancestor'}}}

Choose one of the following cleric domains, you gain the initial domain spell from it. The spell gains the cursebound trait and becomes a revelation spell for you.

-   **Soul** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell
-   **Family** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Curse of Ancestral Meddling" level=1 id='ancestor'}}}

The ancestral spirits you commune with haunt you and meddle with your belongings and actions, either out of a well-intentioned (but ultimately detrimental) attempt to assist you, as punishment for your audacity in circumventing the traditional means of achieving divine power, for their own amusement, or a mixture of the above. Your hair, clothing, and belongings constantly shift and stir, seemingly of their own volition.

**Minor Curse** One of your ancestors becomes predominant in their meddling. The first time you gain this effect each day, roll 1d4 on the table below: Ancestral Influence to determine which type of ancestor becomes predominant. This predominant ancestor guides you to use their preferred type of action. When you try to use one of the types of actions listed for the other ancestors, you must succeed at a DC 4 flat check. On a failure, you spend the action but gain no effect (though you don't lose the spell if you were Casting a Spell). If your action would take 1 minute or longer, it's long enough that you can overcome the meddling, and you don't need to attempt a flat check.

During combat or another tense, round-by-round encounter, other ancestors wrestle for control of your actions. When you roll initiative, and then at the end of each of your turns during the encounter, roll 1d4 and change your predominant ancestor appropriately. Once the encounter ends, you return to the influence of the ancestor you first rolled for the day.

**Moderate Curse** The flat check DC to use other actions is 6, and you get the moderate curse benefit listed for your predominant ancestor.

**Major Curse** The flat check DC is 8, and you get the major curse benefit listed for your predominant ancestor instead of the moderate curse benefit.

| 1d4 | Ancestor     | Preferred Action             | Moderate Curse                                                                                                   | Major Curse                                                                                                          |
| --- | ------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Martial      | Strikes                      | Your Strikes gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and a +2 status bonus to damage.                             | Your Strikes gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and a +6 status bonus to damage.                                 |
| 2   | Skillful     | Perception and Skill actions | You gain a +1 status bonus to skill checks and Perception checks                                                 | You gain a +2 status bonus to skill checks and Perception checks.                                                    |
| 3   | Spellcasting | Cast a Spell                 | Non-cantrip spells without a duration gain a status bonus to their damage and healing equal to the spell's level | Non-cantrip spells without a duration gain a status bonus to their damage and healing equal to the spell's level + 3 |
| 4   |              |                              |                                                                                                                  | You choose which ancestor guides your actions                                                                        |

{{{featureClass "Additional Revelation" level=1 id='ancestor'}}}

You can gain more revelation spells from your curse by selecting the Advanced Revelation and Greater Revelation oracle feats.

-   **Advanced Revelation** ancestral defense
-   **Greater Revelation** ancestral form

## Battle

Warlike forces fill you with physical might and tactical knowledge, aiming to have you uphold the glory of combat, fight to improve the world, prepare against the necessity of conflict, or endure the inevitability of war. You might draw upon the collective spirits of those who fought in wars over the ages.

You are no stranger to the trappings of warfare.

-   You are trained in medium and heavy armor (at 13th level, you also gain expert proficiency in these armors)
-   You are trained in martial weapons (at 11th level, you gain expert proficiency for martial weapons, and you become trained in one group of advanced weapons)
-   You are trained in Athletics
-   You gain the shield cantrip
-   You gain the call to arms revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Divine Domain Revelation" level=1 id='ancestor'}}}

Choose one of the following cleric domains, you gain the initial domain spell from it. The spell gains the cursebound trait and becomes a revelation spell for you.

-   **Might** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell
-   **Zeal** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Curse of Ancestral Meddling" level=1 id='ancestor' altered=true}}}

You thrive while adrenaline flows and your life depends on your might alone, but holding the collective battle prowess of the ages within you leaves your body weakened after a fight. You smell faintly of steel and blood no matter how you try to remove or mask the scent, you appear more muscular than you actually are, and you hear the faint clash and clamor of battle in the distance at all times.

**Minor Curse** Your body languishes when you aren't bringing harm to your foes. You take a -2 status penalty to AC and saving throws, but each time you take an action with the attack trait, you can suspend these penalties until the start of your next turn.

**Moderate Curse** The strain of conflict wears upon your body, even though you gain vitality from it. Taking an action with the attack trait reduces the penalty from your minor curse to -1 rather than suspending it entirely. You gain a +2 status bonus to weapon and unarmed damage rolls. You also gain fast healing equal to half your level while in a non-trivial combat encounter.

**Major Curse** Your body proves capable of truly heroic feats, but doing so interferes with your mental focus. Your moderate curse's fast healing is equal to your level, and its damage bonus is +6. You gain a +1 status bonus to Athletics as well as to weapon and unarmed attack rolls, but you are stupefied 2.

{{{featureClass "Additional Revelation" level=1 id='ancestor'}}}

You can gain more revelation spells from your curse by selecting the Advanced Revelation and Greater Revelation oracle feats.

-   **Advanced Revelation** battlefield persistence
-   **Greater Revelation** heroic feat

## Bones

Your mystery imparts an understanding of death and undeath in all their macabre complexity. You might have had a brush with death yourself—maybe even dying and returning to life—or carry the touch of undeath in your blood.

You can cleverly leverage the subtleties of life and death to your benefit.

-   Each day during your preparations, you can choose to align yourself in the confluence of positive and negative energy so as to gain negative healing, which means you are harmed by positive damage and healed by negative effects as if you were undead (if you already have negative healing, instead the DC of your recovery checks is equal to 9 + your current dying value)
-   You are trained in Medicine
-   You gain the chill touch cantrip
-   You gain the soul siphon revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Divine Domain Revelation" level=1 id='Bones'}}}

Choose one of the following cleric domains, you gain the initial domain spell from it. The spell gains the cursebound trait and becomes a revelation spell for you.

-   **Death** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell
-   **Undeath** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Curse of Ancestral Meddling" level=1 id='Bones'}}}

Your body is slowly decaying even though you are alive, and using your powers furthers this unnatural living death. You carry a touch of the grave about you, manifesting as bloodless pallor, a faint smell of earth, or deathly cold skin.

**Minor Curse** Bones protrude through your skin and your flesh rots, combining with a stench of decay and an unearthly chill. Non-magical effects that would restore your Hit Points only grant you half as many HP as normal.

**Moderate Curse** Your dead flesh continues to rot, affecting your health. You become drained 1, and this drained condition is cumulative with any other drained conditions you gain. This drained condition is removed only when you Refocus; effects that normally remove the drained condition reduce your drained condition to drained 1 instead. In addition, you gain resistance to poison equal to half your level. You gain a +4 status bonus to saves against diseases, poisons, and death effects, and if you roll a success on such a save, you get a critical success instead.

**Major Curse** You stand just steps from the grave. You become wounded 1. This wounded condition is removed only when you Refocus; effects that normally remove the wounded condition reduce your wounded condition to wounded 1 instead. When you would attempt a recovery check, you can choose to get an automatic success instead of rolling, and if you roll a critical failure on a save against a disease, poison, or death effect, you get a failure instead.

## Cosmos

Celestial bodies great and small exert influence on you, giving you sublime cosmic power. Perhaps you see the glittering stars as a divine blessing, or perhaps you feel drawn to the infinitely dark spaces between.

Your body is as much an astronomical one as it is physical.

-   You gain resistance equal to 2 + half your level against all physical damage
-   You are trained in Nature
-   You gain the dancing lights cantrip
-   You gain the call to spray of stars spell

-   **Darkness** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell
-   **Moon** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Curse of the Sky's Call" level=1 id='Cosmos'}}}

You have your head in the clouds—and not just figuratively. Your body is drawn toward the heavens, making you lighter and less substantial than you should be. Your eyes glow with starry light, and your hair and clothing float and drift around you.

**Minor Curse** Your unnatural lightness makes it hard to keep your footing and interact with other physical objects. You are enfeebled 1 and take a -2 penalty to saves and DCs against Grapple, Shove, and other forms of forced movement.

**Moderate Curse** Your body is drawn further skyward. You are enfeebled 2, and the penalty from your minor curse increases to -3. You are treated as one size smaller for wind effects. You gain a +2 status bonus against Trip attempts, you only take half as much damage from falls, and you gain the effects of the Powerful Leap and Quick Jump skill feats. You weigh only half as much, and your Bulk, should someone need to carry you, is also half as much.

**Major Curse** As your body rises, you float just above the ground beneath you. You become enfeebled 4, and the penalty from your minor curse increases to -4. You can walk on liquids as if they were solid; you gain the effects of the Cloud Jump skill feat; and you don't leave tracks, trigger weight-sensitive pressure plates, or otherwise connect with the ground below you.

## Flames

Fire lives at the center of the world, the center of the sun, and the center of civilization.

Like fire itself, you flicker and dance, avoiding effects that would quench your vitality.

-   You have expert proficiency in Reflex saves
-   At 13th level, your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master, and when you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead
-   You are trained in Acrobatics

{{{featureClass "Divine Domain Revelation" level=1 id='Flames'}}}

Choose one of the following cleric domains, you gain the initial domain spell from it. The spell gains the cursebound trait and becomes a revelation spell for you.

-   **Fire** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell
-   **Sun** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Curse of Engulfing Flames" level=1 id='Flames'}}}

You see flames and smoke wherever you look. These flames might be imagined, or they might be a preternatural glimpse of the metaphorical fires that empower the entire multiverse—but you always see them. Fires flare noticeably (though not dangerously) in your presence, you occasionally smoke slightly, and your body is almost painfully hot to the touch.

**Minor Curse** The smoke, heat, and crackling flames of your curse fill your vision and all your other senses. Creatures further than 30 feet are concealed from you. You can't benefit from effects that would allow you to ignore or mitigate this concealment, as normal for effects of an oracular curse.

**Moderate Curse** Smoke and flickering visions of flame fill your senses more completely, and harmless flickers of obscuring flames also fill your space. You are concealed from other creatures, though as the other creatures aren't cursed themselves, they can benefit from effects that would allow them to ignore or mitigate the concealed condition, as normal. All other creatures and objects are concealed from you regardless of distance; however, when casting a fire spell, you automatically succeed at the flat check for this concealed condition for targets within 30 feet. All your senses become imprecise beyond 30 feet, meaning everything past 30 feet that you'd normally be able to see is hidden from you.

**Major Curse** The flames surrounding you are no longer simply visions. An aura of fire surrounds you in a 10-foot emanation, dealing 4d6 fire damage (basic Reflex save) to all other creatures in the aura at the end of each of your turns. You lose 1d6 Hit Points at the end of your turn each round, with no save; if you have a weakness to fire, increase the number of HP you lose by that weakness.

You can suppress your aura until the start of your next turn by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to diminish the flames, causing neither you nor anyone in the aura to take damage. While Refocusing to reduce your curse, you are continually diminishing the flames, so you don't lose HP. The flames subside if you fall unconscious, but they resume when you wake up unless you rested for long enough to reset your curse. As usual for oracular curses, you can't mitigate or reduce the lost Hit Points in any way, though you can still heal the lost HP normally after the fact.

## Life

The never-ending flow of positive energy within living beings is palpable to you. You might uphold the sanctity of life, or perhaps you seek to undermine it. You might draw power from the collective vitality of the world's living creatures, hold some connection to the Positive Energy Plane.

Your body is a deep reservoir of life energy.

-   At each level, you gain Hit Points equal to 10 + your Constitution modifier from the oracle class, instead of 8 + your Constitution modifier
-   You are trained in Medicine
-   You gain the stabilize cantrip
-   You gain the life link revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Divine Domain Revelation" level=1 id='Life'}}}

Choose one of the following cleric domains, you gain the initial domain spell from it. The spell gains the cursebound trait and becomes a revelation spell for you.

-   **Healing** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell
-   **Repose** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Curse of Ancestral Meddling" level=1 id='Life'}}}

Life energy flows outward from you and connects you to all living things, but you expend your vital essence to do so. Your presence comforts the ill and injured, causes scars to fade slightly, spurs new growth in plants, and otherwise infuses your surroundings with vitality.

**Minor Curse** As your life force seeps outward, it becomes more difficult to keep your body functioning. Effects that restore Hit Points to you take a status penalty equal to half your level (minimum 1) to the number of HP you recover.

**Moderate Curse** The flow of life energy away from you can't be reversed. In addition to the effects of your minor curse, you can't be healed by magical effects originating from other creatures. However, if you are unconscious, magical effects can restore you to 1 HP (but no higher). You are affected normally by healing elixirs, potions, and other items. When you cast heal and all your targets are living creatures, you roll d12s instead of d8s for the amount of healing.

Whenever you finish casting a non-cantrip spell, you restore Hit Points equal to the spell level to your choice of either one target of the spell or the creature nearest to you. You can't heal yourself in this way. This healing has the healing, necromancy, and positive traits, as well as the tradition trait of the spell.

**Major Curse** Life energy tears through you to empower your magic. Some of your spells carry positive energy with them. Each time you use a spell slot to cast a 5th-level or higher spell that takes 2 or more actions to cast, you disperse positive energy in a 30-foot burst with the effects of a 3-action heal spell with a level 4 lower than that of the spell you cast. This healing occurs immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. You don't benefit from this healing. Instead, you lose double the number of Hit Points rolled for the heal spell.

## Lore

Knowledge and information come freely to you. You might use this lore to gain power or perhaps to understand the divine mysteries of the multiverse. You might have a conduit to the fabled Akashic Record, maintain a subtle telepathic connection to the collective subconscious of all living creatures, or follow in the footsteps of an archfey.

You hold more mystical knowledge within you than most.

-   For each level of spell you can cast, you have one additional spell in your Spell Repertoire
-   You are trained in Occultism and one Lore of your choosing
-   You gain the read aura cantrip
-   You gain the brain drain revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Divine Domain Revelation" level=1 id='Lore'}}}

Choose one of the following cleric domains, you gain the initial domain spell from it. The spell gains the cursebound trait and becomes a revelation spell for you.

-   **Knowledge** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell
-   **Truth** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Curse of Torrential Knowledge" level=1 id='Lore' altered=true}}}

You have a link to true divine knowledge, but your mortal mind struggles to process and act on what you know. Loose materials around you, such as dust, grains of rice, and droplets of water, slowly shift to form strange runes or faint indecipherable writing, and you sometimes speak unintelligible truths or statements in unknown languages without realizing it.

**Minor Curse** You take a -4 penalty to initiative, as trying to process a surge of information about what's happening around you slows your ability to respond to it.

**Moderate Curse** The flow of information through your mind grows. The attention you divert to process this huge influx of information means you are always flat-footed. At the start of each of your turns, you automatically make one check to Recall Knowledge as a free action. This uses a skill of your choice that has the Recall Knowledge action, using a result equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus in that skill (with no other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).

**Major Curse** The massive flow of information clouding your mind overwhelms your ability to communicate with others. You can understand all languages, but you can't speak, use linguistic effects, or otherwise communicate with your allies. If you Cast a Spell with a verbal component, you become stupefied 2 until the end of your next turn. You gain a +4 status bonus on saving throws against linguistic effects.

## Tempest

The fury of the wind and waves pounds in your heart, whether your power flows from natural storms or the elemental lords of air and water.

You can see perfectly through wind and water, and you send electric charges through both air and water.

-   You never take penalties to Perception from wind, rain, fog, or other precipitation, or from looking through water or being underwater, and such conditions don't cause anything to be concealed from you
-   When you deal physical damage with a non-cantrip air or water spell, you deal an additional 1 electricity damage per spell level
-   You are trained in Nature
-   You gain the electric arc cantrip
-   You gain the tempest touch revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Divine Domain Revelation" level=1 id='Tempest'}}}

Choose one of the following cleric domains, you gain the initial domain spell from it. The spell gains the cursebound trait and becomes a revelation spell for you.

-   **Lightning** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell
-   **Water** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Curse of Torrential Knowledge" level=1 id='Tempest'}}}

You are the center of your own tiny tempest, ever surrounded by wind and rain that worsens the more you tap into your elemental powers. Even when you are calm and at rest, your hair and clothing are blown about by gentle winds, you are slightly damp, and your touch often comes with a static shock.

**Minor Curse** An aura of a whirling storm whips up in a 5-foot emanation around you and in your space. The aura puts out small non-magical fires 1 round after they're lit or brought into your aura.

Electrical energy builds up within your storm, turning you into a lightning rod; you gain weakness 2 to electricity, and electricity spells or effects that have additional effects for a creature wearing or holding metal treat you as though you were wearing metal.

**Moderate Curse** Your minor curse's aura expands to a 10-foot emanation and carries rain on the winds. The whirling winds impose a -2 circumstance penalty on ranged attack rolls using physical ammunition that target you or originate from you. Your weakness to electricity increases to 5 or half your level, whichever is greater, but torrential rain grants you an equal amount of fire resistance.

**Major Curse** Your minor curse's aura expands to a 15-foot emanation and grows stronger. High winds blowing outward in the aura impede creatures' progress. The aura is difficult terrain for Large and smaller creatures on the ground, and for Huge or smaller flying creatures. You aren't affected by this difficult terrain.

The electricity arcing through you becomes dangerous. Any creature that touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or non-reach melee weapon takes 1d6 electricity damage. As normal, this doesn't affect creatures you touch.

## Time

Whether by accident, fate, or purposeful meddling, you exist slightly outside of time. While initially unmoored by moments, the countless march of milliseconds builds up to drift you further and further out of sync with your natural timeline, often in contradictory directions. You might view this as a blessing, perhaps as a sign you're somehow beyond mortality or you can't be contained within reality's limitations, or you might view it as a cruel curse that causes your own life to slip by adrift even as you gain power over time. Many oracles of time are without faith and either come to rely upon their own instincts to survive or else turn to strange rituals and forbidden magic in an attempt to break free of time's grasp.

Time passes more swiftly for you than it does for those around you, enabling you to cover more distance in what others perceive as the same amount of time.

You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed. At 6th level, this increases to a +15-foot status bonus; at 10th level, this increases to a +20-foot status bonus; at 14th level, this increases to a +25-foot status bonus; and at 18th level, it increases to a +30-foot status bonus.

Your disjointed movement makes it harder for creatures to hit you as you move. You gain a +1 status bonus to AC against attacks made against you from reactions or free actions while you're moving

-   You are trained in Occultism
-   You gain the time sense cantrip
-   You gain the temporal distortion revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Divine Domain Revelation" level=1 id='Time'}}}

Choose one of the following cleric domains, you gain the initial domain spell from it. The spell gains the cursebound trait and becomes a revelation spell for you.

-   **Fate** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell
-   **Time** you gain the TODO as a revelation spell

{{{featureClass "Curse of Torrential Knowledge" level=1 id='Time' altered=true }}}

Time passes differently for you than everyone else. You experience fluxes that might manifest as minor day-to-day changes in your apparent age, such as a gray lock of hair or a disappearing wrinkle, or as occasional ghostly temporal afterimages that slightly trail your movement.

**Minor Curse** As you draw upon your mystery, time's passage becomes more disjointed, aging, regressing, or warping you out of sync. You become enfeebled 1. In addition, you take a -2 penalty to saving throws against effects that would make you fatigued or slowed.

**Moderate Curse** Time distorts further, increasing your muscular atrophy, age regression, or warping while making effects pass you by at an increased rate. The value of your enfeebled condition increases to 2 and the penalty from your minor curse increases to -3. Your status bonus to AC against attacks made against you from reactions or free actions while you're moving increases to +2.

In addition, spells affecting you last less time; their duration is reduced by half, to a minimum of 1 round. This doesn't reduce the spell's duration for other targets affected by the same spell.

Finally, all non-permanent conditions affecting you that have a duration measured in rounds, minutes, or hours have their duration reduced by half, to a minimum of 1 round.Any afflictions (such as poisons, diseases, and curses) affecting you have their maximum duration, onset time, and time for each stage reduced by half. Spells, conditions, and afflictions that last “until your next daily preparations” last for 12 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. This doesn't change the duration you're temporarily immune, the rate at which you can use abilities that have a frequency, or any other features based on the passage of time.

**Major Curse** You become so out of sync with time that it's hard for you to act, but when you do act, you do so with incredible speed. You become slowed 1, the value of your enfeebled condition increases to 3, and the penalty from your minor curse increases to -4. Time passes so much faster for you that your steps appear as a blur of motion to others. You gain a +4 status bonus to initiative rolls.

Whenever you move, you're concealed while you're moving and until the start of your next turn. As normal for concealment where your location is still obvious, you can't use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. Your status bonus to AC against attacks made against you from reactions or free actions while you're moving increases to +4.

At the end of a turn you cast a non-cantrip spell, you can teleport to a square within 10 feet as a free action. This action has the teleportation trait and does not trigger your benefits for moving.
