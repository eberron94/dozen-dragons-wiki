_You are skilled and opportunistic. Using your sharp wits and quick reactions, you take advantage of your opponents' missteps and strike where it hurts most. You play a dangerous game, seeking thrills and testing your skills, and likely don't care much for any laws that happen to get in your way. While the path of every rogue is unique and riddled with danger, the one thing you all share in common is the breadth and depth of your skills._

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Dexterity or other

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity or an option from rogue's racket.

**Hit Points** 8 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see the following key terms in many rogue class features.

**Debilitation** Debilitations apply conditions and other negative effects to a creature. When the creature is affected by a new debilitation, any previous one it was affected by ends.

**Flourish** Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

## In Combat

You move about stealthily so you can catch foes unawares. You're a precision instrument, more useful against a tough boss or distant spellcaster than against rank-and-file soldiers.

# Proficiencies

You are trained in Stealth, one or more skills determined by your rogue's racket, and a number of additional skills equal to 7 plus your Intelligence modifier.

**+** When you roll a success with this save, you get a critical success instead.

**++** When you roll a critical failure with this save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure with this save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.

# Class Features

As a rogue, you gain the following class feature at the listed level. Additionally, at 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a rogue class feat.

{{{featureClass "Rogue's Racket" level=1}}}

As you started on the path of the rogue, you began to develop your own style to pursue your illicit activities. Your racket shapes your rogue techniques and the way you approach a job, while building your reputation in the criminal underworld for a certain type of work. A client with deep pockets might even hire a team of rogues for a particular heist, each specializing in a different racket, in order to cover all the bases. Choose a rogue's racket.

Rackets can be found below.

{{{featureClass "Sneak Attack" level=1}}}

When your enemy can't properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the flat-footed condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, a ranged weapon attack, or a ranged unarmed attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.

As your rogue level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.

| Sneak Attack     | 1st level | 5th level | 11th level | 17th level |
| ---------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| precision damage | +1d6      | +2d6      | +3d6       | +4d6       |

{{{featureClass "Surprise Attack" level=1}}}

You spring into combat faster than foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are flat-footed to you.

{{{featureClass "Skill Monkey" level=1 altered=true}}}

At 1st level and every odd level thereafter, you gain a skill feat and a skill increase. These skill increases have the same restrictions as the universal ones (at 7th level you can increase to master, at 15th level you can become legendary).

{{{featureClass "Deny Advantage" level=3}}}

As someone who takes advantage of others' defenses, you are careful not to leave such openings yourself. You aren't flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Tricks" level=5}}}

You have become thoroughly familiar with the tools of your trade. When you critically succeed at an attack roll against a flat-footed creature while using an agile or finesse simple weapon or unarmed attack, or when using any of the rogue weapons, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon or unarmed attack.

{{{featureClass "Evasion" level=7}}}

You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=7}}}

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Debilitating Strikes" level=7}}}

When taking advantage of an opening, you both hinder and harm your foe. You gain the Debilitating Strike free action.

{{{featureClass "Improved Evasion" level=13}}}

Your ability to elude danger is matchless. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.

{{{featureClass "Double Debilitation" level=15}}}

Your opportunistic attacks are particularly detrimental. When you use Debilitating Strike, you can apply two debilitations simultaneously; removing one removes both.

{{{featureClass "Greater Weapon Specialization" level=15}}}

The weapons you've mastered become truly fearsome in your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Slippery Mind" level=17}}}

You play mental games and employ cognitive tricks to throw off mind-altering effects. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Master Strike" level=17}}}

You can incapacitate an unwary foe with a single strike. Your proficiency rank for your rogue class DC increases to master. You gain the Master Strike free action.

# Rackets [Sub Class]

As you started on the path of the rogue, you began to develop your own style to pursue your illicit activities. Your racket shapes your rogue techniques and the way you approach a job, while building your reputation in the criminal underworld for a certain type of work. A client with deep pockets might even hire a team of rogues for a particular heist, each specializing in a different racket, in order to cover all the bases.

## Eldritch Trickster

When it comes to a big heist, every rogue worth their salt knows that magic can throw meticulous plans into chaos, whether in the form of arcane wards or pesky divinations. You dabble in magic just enough to help handle these problems by jury-rigging spells and throwing a bit of your own magic into the mix. You might be a solitary thief, performing burglaries that can't be explained by skill alone, or a specialist called in by other rogues to deal with magical security measures. You might even be on the up-and-up, hired to test magical defenses or even build them yourself.

Choose a multiclass archetype that has a basic, expert, and master spellcasting feat. You gain that archetype's dedication feat as a bonus feat even though you don't meet its level prerequisite, though you must meet its other prerequisites. For you, the Magical Trickster rogue feat has a prerequisite of 2nd level instead of 4th level. You can choose the spellcasting ability score for the multiclass archetype you chose as your key ability score.

## Mastermind

Where others might use sleight of hand or a silver tongue to achieve their objectives, you rely on your intellect to craft intricate schemes. You likely view your operations as a chess game, always planning 10 steps ahead where others might plan three. You might be a detective determined to solve crimes or a spymaster in the service of a powerful family or nation. If you operate outside the law, you might be an aspiring crime lord or information broker, excellent at directing others toward suitable jobs.

If you successfully identify a creature using Recall Knowledge, that creature is flat-footed against your attacks until the start of your next turn; if you critically succeed, it's flat-footed against your attacks for 1 minute.

You're trained in Society and one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion. You can choose Intelligence as your key ability score.

## Ruffian

You prefer to strong-arm or intimidate others rather than rely on finesse or fancy tricks. You might be an enforcer for organized crime, a highway bandit, or a noble who bullies others with threats of your family's power. Or, you might use your skills on the up and up, in a private security detail or as a guard in a city with the right temperament.

You use whatever tools you have at hand to get the job done. You can deal sneak attack damage with any simple weapon, in addition to the weapons listed in the sneak attack class feature. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using a simple weapon and the target has the flat-footed condition (unable to focus on defending itself), you also apply the critical specialization effect for the weapon you're wielding. You don't gain these benefits if the weapon has a damage die larger than d8 (after applying any abilities that alter its damage die size).

You're trained in Intimidation and medium armor. You can choose Strength as your key ability score. When you gain light armor expertise, you also gain expert proficiency in medium armor, and when you gain light armor mastery, you also gain master proficiency in medium armor.

## Scoundrel

You use fast-talking, flattery, and a silver tongue to avoid danger and escape tricky situations. You might be a grifter or con artist, traveling from place to place with a new story or scheme. Your racket is also ideal for certain reputable professions, like barrister, diplomat, or politician.

When you successfully Feint, the target is flat-footed against melee attacks you attempt against it until the end of your next turn. On a critical success, the target is flat-footed against all melee attacks until the end of your next turn, not just yours.

You're trained in Deception and Diplomacy. You can choose Charisma as your key ability score.

## Thief

Nothing beats the thrill of taking something that belongs to someone else, especially if you can do so completely unnoticed. You might be a pickpocket working the streets, a cat burglar sneaking through windows and escaping via rooftops, or a safecracker breaking into carefully guarded vaults. You might even work as a consultant, testing clients' defenses by trying to steal something precious.

When a fight breaks out, you prefer swift, lightweight weapons, and you strike where it hurts. When you attack with a finesse melee weapon, you can add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls instead of your Strength modifier.

You are trained in Thievery.
