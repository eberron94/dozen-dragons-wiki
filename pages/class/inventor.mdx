_Any tinkerer can follow a diagram to make a device, but you invent the impossible! Every strange contraption you dream up is a unique experiment pushing the edge of possibility, a mysterious machine that seems to work for only you. You're always on the verge of the next great breakthrough, and every trial and tribulation is another opportunity to test and tune. If you can dream it, you can build it._

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Intelligence

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Intelligence.

**Hit Points** 8 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see the following terms in many inventor class features.

**Gadget** Gadgets are consumable technological inventions with innovative uses.

**Modification** An ability with this trait alters your innovation's construction. If you have the reconfigure class feature, you can retrain these feats more easily.

**Unstable** Unstable actions use experimental applications of your innovation that even you can't fully predict, and that are hazardous to your innovation (and potentially you). When you take an unstable action, attempt a DC 17 flat check immediately after applying its effects. On a failure, the innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions. On a critical failure, you also take an amount of fire damage equal to your level. As the innovation's creator, you can spend 10 minutes retuning your innovation and making adjustments to return it to functionality, at which point you can use unstable actions with that innovation again.

To take an unstable action, you must be using your innovation (for example, wearing an armor innovation or wielding a weapon innovation). If you have a minion innovation, some unstable actions are taken by the minion instead of you. In these cases, only the minion can take that action, and the minion needs to have been Commanded that turn to take the action. If you critically fail the flat check, the minion takes the damage instead of you.

Some actions have an Unstable Function entry, which you can use to add the unstable trait for a bigger benefit. If you're unable to use unstable actions, you can still use the action normally, but you can't use the unstable function.

## In Combat

You rely on your inventions as much as possible, testing their functionalities under a variety of conditions. You don't set out to achieve anything as banal as simply winning a fight; you seek to collect valuable data that can be used to improve your creations!

# Proficiencies

You are trained in Arcana and a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier.

# Class Features

As an inventor, you gain the following class feature and sub-class features at the listed level. Additionally, at 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain an inventor class feat.

{{{featureClass "Innovation" level=1}}}

While you're always creating inventions, there's one that represents your preeminent work, the one that you hope— with refinement—might change the world. Choose one innovation. Your innovation's level is equal to your level. If your innovation is destroyed, you can spend 1 day of downtime and attempt a Crafting check with a high DC for your level; on a success, you rebuild it. An innovation only works due to your constant maintenance and tinkering, and therefore has no market Price.

Innovations can be found below.

{{{featureClass "Overdrive" level=1}}}

You have a bevy of smaller devices of your own invention, from muscle stimulants to concussive pistons. When it's necessary, you can throw them into overdrive to assist you in combat.

{{{featureClass "Explode" level=1}}}

Your innovation is a creation barely held together by your own engineering, always on the edge of completely falling apart. Though this adds risk, it also means you can coax it to perform far beyond its design specifications using special unstable actions.

While inventors can learn various unstable actions over their career, all at least know how to make their innovation Explode.

{{{featureClass "Peerless Inventor" level=1}}}

You are constantly inventing, and your skill at crafting is unimpeachable. You gain the Inventor skill feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites.

{{{featureClass "Shield Block" level=1}}}

You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.

{{{featureClass "Expert Overdrive" level=3}}}

You've increased your skill in crafting, and you can put your devices into a more powerful state of overdrive. You become an expert in Crafting, and on a successful use of Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by 1.

{{{featureClass "Reconfigure" level=3}}}

You've become an expert in all crafts and are always adjusting your inventions. You can attempt to change the modifications on your innovation by spending 1 day of downtime tinkering with it and attempting a Crafting check, with a high DC for your level. On a success, you can change one modification you've chosen for your innovation to a different modification of the same kind (initial, breakthrough, or revolutionary).

If you have any modification feats, on a successful check you can choose to instead retrain a modification feat to a different modification feat. The new feat has to meet the standard restrictions for retraining.

{{{featureClass "Master Overdrive" level=7}}}

Your mastery of invention and crafting enhances your Overdrive even further. You become a master in Crafting, and on a successful Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by a total of 2, replacing the increase from Expert Overdrive.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=13}}}

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Resolve" level=11}}}

You've steeled your mind with resolve. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Complete Reconfiguration" level=13}}}

When it comes to crafting and tinkering, you've become incredibly adept at changing your modifications to adjust your innovation's functionality. When you spend downtime to reconfigure your innovation and succeed at your Crafting check, you can swap any number of modifications, swap your offensive boost, or retrain any number of modification feats, rather than one. You still must swap a modification only with one of the same type (initial, breakthrough, or revolutionary).

{{{featureClass "Greater Weapon Specialization" level=15}}}

The weapons you've mastered become truly fearsome in your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Legendary Overdrive" level=7}}}

Your peerless inventing and Crafting ability has supercharged your Overdrives. You become legendary in Crafting, and on a successful Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by a total of 3, replacing the increase from master overdrive.

{{{featureClass "Juggernaut" level=17}}}

Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Infinite Invention" level=19}}}

Your ability to adjust your innovation has reached impossible heights, and you can use these skills to make major adjustments in your spare time. During your daily preparations, you automatically fix your innovation if it's destroyed or broken, and you can change to a different innovation (armor, construct, weapon, or other type you have access to) and change your modifications and offensive boost.

If you have any feats that had your previous innovation as a prerequisite, you can't use them until you retrain the feats as normal. However, it takes you only 1 day of downtime to retrain such a feat into a feat that has your new innovation as a prerequisite, instead of 1 week.

# Innovation [Sub Class]

While you're always creating inventions, there's one that represents your preeminent work, the one that you hope— with refinement—might change the world. Choose one of the below innovations. Your innovation's level is equal to your level. If your innovation is destroyed, you can spend 1 day of downtime and attempt a Crafting check with a high DC for your level; on a success, you rebuild it. An innovation only works due to your constant maintenance and tinkering, and therefore has no market Price.

## Armor Innovation

Your innovation is a cutting-edge suit of medium armor with a variety of attached gizmos and devices. Choose one of the sets of statistics from the table below for your innovation armor.

| Medium Armor    | AC Bonus | Dex Cap | Check Penalty | Speed Penalty | Strength | Bulk | Group     | Armor Traits |
| --------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------- | ---- | --------- | ------------ |
| Power suit      | +4       | +1      | -2            | -5 feet       | 16       | 2    | composite | ---          |
| Subterfuge suit | +1       | +4      | -1            | ---           | 10       | 1    | composite | ---          |

Your innovation armor can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as ordinary armor. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in medium armor.

Choose one initial armor modification to apply to your innovation.

{{{featureClass "Breakthrough Innovation" level=7 id="armor"}}}

You've made a breakthrough in your field of study and discovered a powerful new way to enhance your innovation. Choose a breakthrough armor modification to apply to your innovation. You can choose an initial armor modification instead if you prefer.

{{{featureClass "Offensive Boost" level=9 id="armor"}}}

You've made additions to your innovation to upgrade your offensive capabilities. During your daily preparations, choose one weapon; you deal an additional 1d6 damage when you melee Strike with the chosen weapon or unarmed attacks. You can spend downtime to switch to a different boost in the same way as switching your modification. Choose one of the following boosts, with the damage type in parentheses.

-   **Chill (Cold)** Your innovation rapidly absorbs heat, creating an intense chill.
-   **Ignition (Fire)** Your innovation shoots out jets of searing flame.
-   **Jolt (Electricity)** Your innovation jolts foes with charges of electricity.
-   **Momentum (Bludgeoning)** Your innovation slams into foes with added momentum.
-   **Saws (Slashing)** Your innovation reveals spinning sawblades during your attacks.
-   **Spike (Piercing)** Your innovation reveals wicked spikes during your attacks.
-   **Vitriol (Acid)** Your innovation releases spurts of caustic acid.

{{{featureClass "Armor Specialization Innovation" level=11 id="armor"}}}

You gain access to the armor specialization effect with your armor innovation.

{{{featureClass "Revolutionary Innovation" level=15 id="armor"}}}

You are an unparalleled genius and have discovered a technique that will revolutionize your chosen field—or at least for the time being, your innovation! Choose a revolutionary armor modification to apply to your innovation. You can also choose an initial or breakthrough armor modification, if you prefer.

## Weapon Innovation

Your innovation is an impossible-looking weapon augmented by numerous unusual mechanisms. It begins with the same statistics as a level 0 common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another level 0 simple or martial weapon to which you have access. You can instead use the statistics of a 1st-level common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another 1st-level simple or martial weapon to which you have access, but you must pay the monetary Price for the weapon.

An innovation weapon can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as an ordinary weapon. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in simple or martial weapons. If you use the Overdrive action, you can choose to change the additional damage from Overdrive to fire damage.

Choose one initial weapon modification to apply to your innovation. These modifications grant additional weapon traits, sometimes with extra abilities. A modification might give your weapon the versatile trait with a damage type that the weapon could already deal, either from its base damage type or from an existing versatile trait. In that case, if you select that modification, you can instead choose to give the weapon the versatile trait for a different damage type: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

{{{featureClass "Critical Weapon Innovation" level=5 id="weapon"}}}

You gain access to the critical specialization effect with your weapon innovation.

{{{featureClass "Breakthrough Innovation" level=7 id="weapon"}}}

You've made a breakthrough in your field of study and discovered a powerful new way to enhance your innovation. Choose a breakthrough weapon modification to apply to your innovation. You can choose an initial weapon modification instead if you prefer.

{{{featureClass "Offensive Boost" level=9 id="weapon"}}}

You've made additions to your innovation to upgrade your offensive capabilities. Your weapon innovation deals an additional 1d6 damage. You can spend downtime to switch to a different boost in the same way as switching your modification. Choose one of the following boosts, with the damage type in parentheses.

-   **Chill (Cold)** Your innovation rapidly absorbs heat, creating an intense chill.
-   **Ignition (Fire)** Your innovation shoots out jets of searing flame.
-   **Jolt (Electricity)** Your innovation jolts foes with charges of electricity.
-   **Momentum (Bludgeoning)** Your innovation slams into foes with added momentum.
-   **Saws (Slashing)** Your innovation reveals spinning sawblades during your attacks.
-   **Spike (Piercing)** Your innovation reveals wicked spikes during your attacks.
-   **Vitriol (Acid)** Your innovation releases spurts of caustic acid.

{{{featureClass "Revolutionary Innovation" level=15 id="weapon"}}}

You are an unparalleled genius and have discovered a technique that will revolutionize your chosen field—or at least for the time being, your innovation! Choose a revolutionary weapon modification to apply to your innovation. You can also choose an initial or breakthrough weapon modification, if you prefer.

## Construct

Your innovation is a mechanical creature, such as a clockwork construct made of cogs and gears. It's a prototype construct companion, and you can adjust most of its base statistics by taking feats at higher levels, such as Advanced Companion. If you use the Overdrive action, your construct gains the same Overdrive benefits you do, and it also takes the same amount of fire damage on a critical failure.

You know how to spend additional time directing, controlling, or programming your construct innovation for a more complex plan of action. You can spend 2 actions to Command instead of 1 when commanding your construct companion; your construct companion can then use an additional action (normally 3 actions, rather than 2).

Choose one initial construct modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial construct modifications to which you have access. These modifications alter the construct's abilities or form.
