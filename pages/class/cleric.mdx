_Deities work their will upon the world in infinite ways, and you serve as one of their most stalwart mortal servants. Blessed with divine magic, you live the ideals of your faith, adorn yourself with the symbols of your church, and train diligently to wield your deity's favored weapon. Your spells might protect and heal your allies, or they might punish foes and enemies of your faith, as your deity wills. Yours is a life of devotion, spreading the teachings of your faith through both word and deed._

> **GM Note** The cloistered cleric and warpriest, by rules as written, are sub-classes of cleric with the major difference is the proficiency increases. But due to the formatting of this wiki, I have separated the cleric sub-classes. This page contains the cloistered cleric.

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Wisdom

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Wisdom.

**Hit Points** 8 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see the following term in many cleric class features.

**Metamagic** These actions tweak your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action.

## In Combat

You primarily cast spells. Most of your spells can boost, protect, or heal your allies. Depending on your deity, you get extra spells to heal your allies or harm your enemies.

# Proficiencies

You are trained in Religion, a skill determined by your deity, and a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier.

## Perception & Offense

| Proficiencies          | Trained     | Expert     | Master     | Legendary  |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Perception             | _1st level_ | 5th level  | ---        | ---        |
| Divine Spell Tradition | _1st level_ | 7th level  | 15th level | 19th level |
| Simple Weapons         | _1st level_ | ---        | ---        | ---        |
| Deity's Weapon         | _1st level_ | 11th level | ---        | ---        |
| Unarmed Attacks        | _1st level_ | 11th level | ---        | ---        |

**Deity's Weapon** Your deity's preferred weapon. If your deity's favored weapon is uncommon, you also gain access to that weapon.

## Armor Class

| Proficiencies | Trained     | Expert     | Master | Legendary |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ | --------- |
| Unarmored     | _1st level_ | 13th level | ---    | ---       |

## Perception & Saving Throws

| Proficiencies | Trained     | Expert      | Master       | Legendary |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Fortitude     | _1st level_ | 3rd level   | ---          | ---       |
| Reflex        | _1st level_ | 11th level  | ---          | ---       |
| Will          | ---         | _1st level_ | 9th level^+^ | ---       |

**+** When you roll a success with this save, you get a critical success instead.

# Class Features

As a cleric, you gain the following class features at the listed level. Additionally, at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a cleric class feat.

{{{featureClass "Deity" level=1 altered=true}}}

As a cleric, you are a mortal servitor of a deity you revere above all others. The most common deities in Eberron are found here, along with their alignments, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a cleric of that deity. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon.

Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list, once you can prepare spells of their level as a cleric. Some of these spells aren't normally on the divine list, but they're divine spells if you prepare them this way.

A list of all deities can be found here.

#### Anathema

Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity shake your conviction.

If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your faith, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all divine spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual.

#### Abhorrent

Acts fundamentally opposed by your church's alignment or ideals are abhorrent to them. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are abhorrent to them can remove you from their good graces, if they find out. But, if a cleric loses faith in their deity or a champion breaks their code, they can be subject to the original Anathema rules for losing abilities as the source of power is disrupted.

Violating the ideals and goals of the church might risk punishment, but a corrupt faction within it will hide the abhorrent actions. In the case of being caught, churches like the Silver Flame and the Sovereign Host will have a cleric perform a ceremonial version of the Atone ritual as a way to determine if the individual is penitent or not. Instead of losing or gaining divine abilities, the result is interpreted by a superior and only effects the political standing of the atoning individual.

{{{featureClass "Divine Prepared Spellcasting" level=1}}}

Your faith bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a material component pouch.

Each day, you can prepare a number of spells and cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a cleric, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase.

Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls.

| Level | Cantrips | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th |
| ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |

| 16    | 5        | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | --- | ---  |
| 17    | 5        | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | ---  |
| 18    | 5        | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | ---  |
| 19    | 5        | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 1^†^ |
| 20    | 5        | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 1^†^ |

**†** The miraculous spell class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.

Your divine font gives you additional heal or harm spells of your highest level spell slot. The number is equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.

#### Heightening Spells

When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.

#### Cantrips

A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up---this is usually equal to the highest level of cleric spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.

{{{featureClass "Divine Font" level=1}}}

Through your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called positive energy or its counterforce, negative energy. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional heal or harm spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity; if both are listed, you can choose between heal or harm. Once you choose, you can't change your choice short of an ethical shift or divine intervention.

**Healing Font** You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only heal spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.

**Harmful Font** You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only harm spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.

{{{featureClass "Domain Spells (Focus Spells)" level=1}}}

Your deity bestows a special spell related to their powers. Select one domain---a subject of particular interest to you within your religion---from your deity's list. You gain an initial domain spell for that domain, a spell unique to the domain and not available to other clerics. Each domain's theme and domain spells can be found here.

Domain spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells are found here.

{{{featureClass "Resolve" level=9}}}

You've steeled your mind with resolve. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Critical Doctrine" level=13}}}

Your faith drives you forward and your weapon to strike. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using your deity's favored weapon, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect; use your divine spell DC if necessary.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=13}}}

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Miraculous Spell" level=19}}}

You're exalted by your deity and gain truly incredible spells. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using divine spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the Maker of Miracles feat to gain a second slot.
