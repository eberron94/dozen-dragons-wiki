_Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in wreaking havoc and using powerful weapons to carve through your enemies, relying on astonishing durability without needing complicated techniques or rigid training. Your rages draw upon a vicious instinct, which you might associate with an animal, a spirit, or some part of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to hold back the storm of emotions inside them and release their rage only when it matters most._

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Strength

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Strength.

**Hit Points** 12 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see the following key terms in many barbarian class features.

**Flourish** Flourish actions are techniques that require too much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Open** These maneuvers work only as your first salvo on your turn. You can use an open action only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.

**Rage** You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.

## In Combat

Offense is the best defense --- you will need to drop foes before they can exploit your relatively low defenses. As a member of the party, you can setup your allies by entering flank and performing combat maneuvers like trip, shove, and grapple. You are also a great target for the party to buff.

# Proficiencies

You are trained in Athletics and a number of additional skills equal to 3 plus your Intelligence modifier.

# Class Features

As a barbarian, you gain the following class feature and sub-class features at the listed level. Additionally, at 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a barbarian class feat.

{{{featureClass "Rage" level=1}}}

You gain the Rage action, which lets you fly into a frenzy.

{{{card "action.class.barbarian::.rage"}}}

{{{featureClass "Instinct" level=1}}}

Your rage wells up from a dominant instinctâ€”one you learned from a tradition or that comes naturally to you. Your instinct gives you an ability, requires you to avoid certain behaviors, grants you increased damage and resistances at higher levels, and allows you to select feats tied to your instinct.

Instincts can be found [here](/class/barbarian/instincts.html).

{{{featureClass "Deny Advantage" level=3}}}

Your foes struggle to pass your defenses. You aren't flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.

{{{featureClass "Critical Rage" level=5}}}

Your fury makes your weapons lethal. While raging, you gain access to the critical specialization effects for melee weapons and unarmed attacks.

{{{featureClass "Juggernaut" level=7}}}

Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=7}}}

Your rage helps you hit harder. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Mighty Rage" level=11}}}

Your rage intensifies and lets you burst into action. You gain the Mighty Rage free action.

{{{card "action.class.barbarian::.mighty-rage"}}}

{{{featureClass "Greater Juggernaut" level=13}}}

You have a stalwart physiology. When you roll a critical failure on a Fortitude save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Fortitude save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.

{{{featureClass "Greater Weapon Specialization" level=15}}}

The weapons you've mastered become truly fearsome in your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Indomitable Will" level=15}}}

Your rage makes it difficult to control you. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Quick Rage" level=17}}}

You recover from your Rage quickly, and are soon ready to begin anew. After you spend a full turn without raging, you can Rage again without needing to wait 1 minute.

{{{featureClass "Devastator" level=19}}}

Your Strikes are so devastating that you hardly care about resistance, and your barbarian abilities are unparalleled. Your melee Strikes ignore 10 points of a creature's resistance to their physical damage.
