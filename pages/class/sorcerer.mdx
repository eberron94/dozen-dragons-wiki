_You didn't choose to become a spellcaster—you were born one. There's magic in your blood, whether a divinity touched one of your ancestors, a forebear communed with a primal creature, or a powerful occult ritual influenced your line. Self-reflection and study allow you to refine your inherent magical skills and unlock new, more powerful abilities. The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face the choice of whether you'll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction._

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Charisma

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma.

**Hit Points** 6 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see the following term in many sorcerer class features.

**Metamagic** These actions tweak your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action.

## In Combat

You use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper their movements. You might be too vulnerable to get into melee combat, or your bloodline might give you abilities that help you hold your own in a brawl. While your magic is powerful, to conserve your best spells—or when you've used them all up—you also rely on cantrips.

# Proficiencies

You are trained in one or more skills determined by your bloodline and a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier.

## Class DC & Attacks

| Proficiencies             | Trained     | Expert     | Master     | Legendary  |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |

| Simple Weapons            | _1st level_ | 11th level | ---        | ---        |
| Unarmed Attacks           | _1st level_ | 11th level | ---        | ---        |

**Bloodline Spell Tradition** your bloodline determines your spellcasting tradition.

## Armor Class

| Proficiencies | Trained     | Expert     | Master | Legendary |

| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Perception    | _1st level_ | 11th level  | ---           | ---       |

| Will          | ---         | _1st level_ | 17th level^+^ | ---       |

**+** When you roll a success with this save, you get a critical success instead.

# Class Features

As a sorcerer, you gain the following class feature at the listed level. Additionally, at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an sorcerer class feat.

{{{featureClass "Bloodline" level=1}}}

Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent. This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, additional spells you learn, and additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. The bloodlines presented in this book are as follows.

Bloodlines can be found below.

{{{featureClass "Sorcerer Spontaneous Spellcasting" level=1}}}

Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a material component pouch.

Each day, you can cast a number of spells determined by your level. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the Spell Repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.

Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls.

**†** The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.

#### Heightening Spells

When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.

#### Cantrips

Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.

{{{featureClass "Spell Repertoire" level=1}}}

The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.

You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot, you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new level of spells, your first new spell is always the spell granted by your bloodline, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-level version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.

Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.

#### Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire

As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.

{{{featureClass "Bloodline Spells (Focus Spells)" level=1}}}

Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells unique to your lineage. Bloodline spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found here.

{{{featureClass "Bloodline Magic" level=1 id='Aberrant'}}}

Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using Focus Points or a granted spell from your bloodline using a spell slot, you gain a blood magic effect. If the blood magic offers a choice, make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references to spell level refer to the level of the spell you cast.

{{{featureClass "Signature Spells" level=3}}}

You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=13}}}

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Resolve" level=17}}}

You've steeled your mind with resolve. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Bloodline Paragon" level=19}}}

You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-level spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, and they can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the Bloodline Perfection sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.

# Bloodlines [Sub Class]

Choose your bloodline, the source of your power. It has a major influence on your abilities, determining your spell list, the tradition of spells you cast, and two trained skills.

{{{featureClass "Granted Spells" level=1 id='Aberrant'}}}

You automatically add the following spells to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire class feature. At 1st level, you gain the cantrip and 1st-level spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that level.

-   **Cantrip** daze
-   **1st-level** spider sting
-   **2nd-level** touch of idiocy
