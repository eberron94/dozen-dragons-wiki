You have one of the following causes. Your cause must match your alignment exactly. Your cause determines your champion's reaction, grants you a devotion spell, and defines part of your champion's code.

# Paladin [Lawful Good]

You're honorable, forthright, and committed to pushing back the forces of cruelty. You gain the Retributive Strike champion's reaction and the lay on hands devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these tenets:

-   You must act with honor, never taking advantage of others, lying, or cheating.
-   You must respect the lawful authority of legitimate leadership wherever you go, and follow its laws.

{{{featureClass "Champion Reaction" level=1 id='paladin'}}}

You gain the Retributive Strike reaction.

{{{card "action.class.champion.subclass.paladin.crb.retributive-strike"}}}

{{{featureClass "Divine Smite" level=9 id='paladin'}}}

You surround evil targets in a punishing halo. If you hit with your Retributive Strike, the target takes persistent good damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

{{{featureClass "Exalt" level=9 id='paladin'}}}

When you use Retributive Strike, each ally within 15 feet of you with the target in their melee reach can spend a reaction to Strike the target with a -5 penalty.

# Redeemer [Neutral Good]

You're full of kindness and forgiveness. You gain the Glimpse of Redemption champion's reaction and the lay on hands devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these:

-   You must first try to redeem those who commit evil acts, rather than killing them or meting out punishment. If they then continue on a wicked path, you might need to take more extreme measures.
-   You must show compassion for others, regardless of their authority or station.

{{{featureClass "Champion Reaction" level=1 id='Redeemer'}}}

You gain the Glimpse of Redemption reaction.

{{{card "action.class.champion.subclass.redeemer.crb.glimpse-of-redemption"}}}

{{{featureClass "Divine Smite" level=9 id='Redeemer'}}}

A guilty conscience assails foes who spurn your Glimpse of Redemption. A foe that responds to your Glimpse of Redemption by dealing damage takes persistent good damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

{{{featureClass "Exalt" level=9 id='Redeemer'}}}

You protect multiple allies. You can apply the resistance granted by Glimpse of Redemption to yourself and all allies within 15 feet of you, including the triggering ally, except the resistance is reduced by 2 for all.

# Liberator [Chaotic Good]

You're committed to defending the freedom of others. You gain the Liberating Step champion's reaction and the lay on hands devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these tenets:

-   You must respect the choices others make over their own lives, and you can't force someone to act in a particular way or threaten them if they don't.
-   You must demand and fight for others' freedom to make their own decisions. You may never engage in or countenance slavery or tyranny.

{{{featureClass "Champion Reaction" level=1 id='Liberator'}}}

You gain the Liberating Step reaction.

{{{card "action.class.champion.subclass.liberator.crb.liberating-step"}}}

{{{featureClass "Divine Smite" level=9 id='Liberator'}}}

You punish those who ensnare your allies in bondage. If the triggering enemy was using any effects to make your ally grabbed, restrained, immobilized, or paralyzed when you used Liberating Step, that enemy takes persistent good damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

{{{featureClass "Exalt" level=9 id='Liberator'}}}

You can help your whole group get into position. When you use Liberating Step, if your ally doesn't attempt to break free of an effect, you and all allies within 15 feet can Step, in addition to the triggering ally.
