Eberron embraces swashbuckling action and pulp adventure while adding a layer of noir intrigue. Daring heroes battle villains in high-stakes instances of over-the-top action, dealing with narrow escapes and ominous mysteries that threaten the world's safety. Magic is common, and weaved through everyday life. Blacksmiths use mending for minor repairs, continual flame lamps light the streets, and bound elementals power lightning rails and airships. Eberron is a world painted in shades of grey, where both heroes and villains come in all races, classes, shapes and sizes. It's just as likely that the innkeeping gnome next door is an evil assassin and the tribal orc in the swamp is a holy druidic guardian. A metallic dragon is just as likely as a red one to fall under evil's influence and a coven of hags brings more stability to a region. The gods don't manifest physically, and wielding divine magic to keep evil at bay requires faith in the unseen.

# The Last War

The Last War ravaged the continent of Khorvaire, turned allies into enemies and destroyed an entire nation. It began when the once-unified kingdom of Galifar broke apart when the line of succession was challenged, eventually spawning a bitter struggle for continental control. It was a century marked by shifting alliances, and periods of cold-war stalemates and intense battles and death. The grueling conflict left deep scars on the land and the people, but was nothing compared to The Mourning. The nation of Cyre was suddenly hit by a cataclysmic bank of grey fog and twisted magic. The mist spread quickly until it stopped exactly at the edge of the Cryan border. More than a million died in that single Day of Mourning. No one knows what caused the mourning, or how to stop it from happening again; fear brought the nations to the negotiating table and a treaty was finally signed.

Two years have passed, the peace is tenuous, and the continent is more divided than before the war. Although many celebrated the end of the war, there was no winner and control of the continent is still unsettled. People optimistically refer to it as "The Last War", but distrust between nations continues to rise and most believe that it's only a matter of time until conflict begins again. Meanwhile, refugees from the defunct Cyre are without a home, and the war's end has left the Warforged (sentient metal humanoids created for war) without a purpose. While others struggle to survive, the Dragonmarked dynasties emerged from the war even stronger, more powerful than any nation. Through it all, the forces of good struggle to contain the forces of evil that threaten to break its chains.

# Dragonmarks

Dragonmarks are magical sigils that are passed down through family lines and enhance a particular kind of magic. There are 12 dragonmarks, each manifesting unbidden in specific ancestries. Long ago, the families that carry the marks joined together to form the dragonmarked houses and powerful monopolies.

# The Five Nations

The Five Nations made up the Kingdom of Galifar before the Last War. They are dominated by Humans, who make up half of their population. Citizens of each nation hold a great deal of pride for their home.

**Aundair** Highly magical, Aundair houses the finest magic academy and even the plentiful farming villages know magic in their daily life. You may be from a farming village, or studied at the floating towers of Arcanix, but either way you're sure you're the smartest person in the room, and are likely the most flamboyant.

**Breland** Highly innovative, Breland is known for industry and espionage. It's the home of Sharn, the famous city of towers. It's close to Droaam, so you've seen more of the monstrous races. You're pragmatic, cynical, slightly shady, and don't see the need to follow traditions.

**Karnath** Known for military tradition, they embraced The Blood of Vol during the war and created lots of undead soldiers. You're used to seeing intelligent undead as guards, etc, and you may approve of this practice, or feel it's a disgrace to the strong and honourable tradition Karnath used to have.

**Thrane** The birthplace of The Silver Flame faith, Thrane has been a theocracy for the last 70 years. It's likely that faith is an important part of your life, and you were raised around a strong believe in the importance of fighting evil. Duty, courage, valor, and sacrifice are important to you.

**Cyre** Previously the seat of the rulers of the kingdom, the nation was destroyed in the mourning and exists only in Cyrian memories. Cyre's princess was the rightful heir to the throne, and you take pride in the fact that Cyre alone was right in the war. Yet you lost more than anyone else, and are now a refugee without a home.

# Other Nations

The Five Nations are not the only powers on the contient. Other nations were either caught up in the war or took the opportunity to liberate themselves.

**Darguun** Goblinoids nation, and their ancestral lands. At one point it was part of Cyre, it is now a young, independent nation again. Duty and honor are important here; your place in battle and your virtuous deeds.

**Demon Wastes** Fiends, separated from the rest of the continent by canyons known as the Labyrinth, guarded by tribes of orcs. The Carrion tribes, barbarian humans, live here too. Twisted by its evil, they worship Archfiends and battle the orcs. Either way, you're accustomed to the violence that comes in the harsh wastelands.

**Droaam** A new nation, led by 3 hags and home to the monstrous races. You grew up among all kinds of people everyone is welcome in Droaam. Proud and ambitious, you have a different view on life than most and a desire to prove the monstrous nation to those who don't see
what you do.

**Eldeen Reaches** Fertile farmlands, mainly shifters and druids, the Reaches have ties to Fey. Farmers here used to be part of Aundair, but were unprotected in the war. Farming or nomadic, living in harmony with nature is important. Fiercely independent, you respect druidic guidance, but no one gives orders to a Reacher.

**Lhazaar Principalities** Coastline and Islands with sailors and pirates, that attracts Changelings. A loose collection of cities and areas, you value independence and tend to have little concern for law or order.

**Mror Holds** Ancient dwarven ruins uncovered in the last century. Dwarven clans came together to declare sovereignty, and you've been working to reclaim the old cities and mines, and fight the aberrations rising from the depths below.

**Shadow Marches** Isolated swamp, with twisted fiends and strange creatures, and a hint of madness. A collection of tribal orcs, half-orcs and humans, your traditions have been shaped by the Gatekeepers who fight aberrations.

**Valenar** During the Last War, elves came to this Cyrian land and invoked an ancient claim to it. From a city or a farm, Valenar was born in war, and so war dominates your culture. Farmer, khoravar administrator, or mercenary, you are fearless and stubborn.

**Q'barra** When the Last War began, a fleet of settlers came to Q'barra in search of a new home far from the war. Finding wild jungles, deposits of dragonshards, they also met ancient civilizations of lizardfolk and dragonborn. You might be one of the original Q'barrans, or a settler from one of few settlements.

**Talenta Plains** These open plains are where the wild halflings live their nomadic lifestyles, and dinosaurs roam. Described as an ocean of grasslands, there's not a lot of cities and towns and there are a lot of dinosaurs.

**Zilargo** A nation of gnomes, it's the home of both the largest library and one of the most popular newspaper on the continent. Visitors are concerned about the web of intrigue, blackmail, and the secret police force, but you understand and trust the system, and are perfectly content with it.
