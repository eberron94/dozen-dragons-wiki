# How to use this wiki

The wiki is broken up into three sections. The first section is how to play Pathfinder 2e, including all house rules. Section two is the catalog of all character options, starting with classes. The last section is the lore for Eberron.

## Navigating the wiki

**On mobile**, the navigation menu can be found in the top right.

**On desktop** with full screen, the navigation will be open on the left and a table of contents on the right. On half screen, the table of contents will disappear. You can navigate this wiki by using the arrow keys to move to the next or previous page.

Click on the text of an entry in the navigation to enter that page. If you click the arrow on an entry with the icon will expand the list of sub-pages.

# Card Manager

A special feature of this wiki is the ability to generate material cards from the entries in this wiki. When you click on the icon of an entry, it saves the card. You can then open the card manager menu in the bottom right.

You can view entries you have selected. They can individually be removed by click the x button or you can remove all of them by clicking the trash button. Further uses can be explained by the GM during an in-person session. This is the preferred method of sending the GM your character selections for printing out material cards.

> This feature is only available on desktop.
