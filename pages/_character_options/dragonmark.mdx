A dragonmark is a magical symbol that manifests on the skin, but its color immediately differentiates it from any mundane tattoo. A dragonmark is etched in shades of blue, green, and purple so vivid that they appear to glow, though the mark provides no real illumination.

A dragonmark is associated with one or more magical abilities, and a person who carries a dragonmark can exercise these powers. When a bearer invokes the power of a dragonmark, its colors shimmer and flow, and the skin grows warm to the touch. The mark grows warmer each time its power is used over the course of a day; by the time the bearer has expended his full allotment of spells, the mark is fever-hot and cannot be used again until it cools. Shapechanging ability and illusions can mimic a dragonmark’s appearance, but usually cannot make it warm to the touch.

In keeping with their magical nature, dragonmarks are not simply skin deep. If a mark is cut or scarred, it reappears as the skin that bears it magically heals. If a warrior loses the hand that bears his dragonmark, the mark will manifest elsewhere on his body. Creatures under the effect of polymorph, wild shape, and other shapechanging effects retain their dragonmarks unless they specifically will them to be hidden.

The mark itself can grow, gaining deeper powers and physically expanding in size. A typical least dragonmark covers an area 2 inches square on the skin. Lesser marks are typically 3–5 inches across, while greater and grand dragonmarks are 6–8 inches.

# Marked Bloodlines

Dragonmarks are tied to bloodlines. The dragonmarked houses are the descendants of the families that first manifested the marks, and a character with a dragonmark can almost always find a connection to a dragonmarked house somewhere in the roots of his family tree.

Though the appearance of marks cannot be consistently predicted, approximately half the children born to dragonmarked parents eventually develop dragonmarks of their own. Common belief holds that parents with powerful marks are more likely to produce gifted children; likewise, children often develop the same powers as their parents. Within House Sivis, members of the Torralyn family typically manifest whispering wind, while Syrralans are more likely to possess the power of arcane mark. Houses often arrange marriages with marks in mind.

Despite these beliefs, dragonmarks are clearly about more than selective breeding. A child born to parents possessing least marks might later manifest the greater mark, or no mark at all. It is also known that the hybrid races cannot inherit the marks of their parents, so that a human cannot pass the Mark of Making to a half-elf child. A member of a dragonmarked house reincarnated as another race keeps his dragonmark, but children born to such transformed creatures never possess the dragonmark of the parent’s original race. Though legend states that Erandis d’Vol, the last known heir of the Mark of Death, was a half-dragon, only the Mark of Finding is known to cross racial barriers, manifesting on both humans and half-orcs.

### Mark of Siberys

The people of Khorvaire have a limited understanding of dragonmarks, and Siberys marks are a complete mystery. The magic of a Siberys mark is undeniably powerful, generally replicating spells of 8th or 9th level. Siberys marks are clearly related---visually, thematically, and genetically---to the other marks in their house. A dragonmark heir may spend years perfecting and mastering the powers of his mark, but can never manifest a Siberys mark, while an unmarked scion of a dragonmarked house might suddenly display a Siberys mark against all expectations. Siberys marks are mighty, unpredictable, and rare, and the dragon marked houses keep a careful eye on anyone who manifests one. If its power can be used in the service of the house, fine—but an heir of Siberys who does not conceal his dragonmark ability or remain firmly aligned with his house is likely to fi nd himself the target of assassins.
