The languages found in Eberron are different from those described in the Core Rulebook. This list is not exhaustive, so additional languages could appear over the course of the campaign, but it gives a base line for what you as a player can start with or might experience.

Each language entry will list a script and parent language, when appropriate. This information is useful in determining the difficulty of translation and learning a new language. Additionally, languages have additional traits.

### Starting Languages

You know Karrnon, which is the common tongue for adventurers, and a number of additional languages equal to 1 plus your Intelligence modifier. Not all languages are frequently used, making them harder to learn. You can start knowing one uncommon or rare language and any languages listed in your culture. All other known languages must be common.

**Special** Druid start the game knowing Vvark, which is the druidic language. This does not count toward your number of languages.
