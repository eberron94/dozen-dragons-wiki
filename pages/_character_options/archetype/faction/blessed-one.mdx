The Church of the Silver Flame is dedicated to fighting supernatural forces of evil across Khorvaire. Trying to remain above the lingering conflicts of the Last War, the church focuses its energy on combating extraplanar threats such as possessing devils and corrupting demons. Leading this unceasing war are those directly blessed by the Silver Flame, spiritual heroes who channel the power of the Silver Flame to ward off evil outsiders, cast out possessing spirits, and smite the material forms of the forces of evil.

Blessed Ones of the Silver Flame are drawn from the ranks of the most experienced and dedicated champions of the church, primarily clerics and champions. Wizards (and accomplished mystic theurges of the church) are also drawn to the class, though most of these retain their emphasis on divine spells and powers.

Most blessed of the Silver Flame are active in the world, out on the front lines of the war against evil. A few exorcists might be found in a state of retirement---so physically and emotionally scarred from their experiences that their minds border on insanity.

**Access** You must be an acolyte of the Silver Flame and fight the Hierarchy of Evil.

> This archetype is the Blessed One with a few additional feats.
