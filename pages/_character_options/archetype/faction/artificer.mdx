Artificers in Eberron are often students of magic, though, unlike wizards, artificers treat magic like technology, a complex system of patterns rather than an art form that one needs to perfect through rigorous studying. With their masterful knowledge of magical devices and constructs, it can be said that artificers keep the cogs of the technological marvels of Eberron running.

> The Artificer archetype is based on the conversion done by [Maltilum](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2eCreations/comments/lhpphl/artificer_archetype/). I made major modification for this game, but the base work is theirs.

**Access** Most artificers are from House Cannith, but they do not have a complete monopoly.
