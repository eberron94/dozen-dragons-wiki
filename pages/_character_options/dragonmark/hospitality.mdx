The Mark of Hospitality grants powers related to food and shelter.

**House**: The halflings of House Ghallanda carry the Mark of Hospitality, which is extremely useful in the halflings' native nomadic culture. In the cities of Khorvaire, House Ghallanda operates the Hostelers Guild, whose members include innkeepers, chefs, and restaurateurs. While the guild does not operate every inn and dining establishment in Khorvaire, it enforces standards and performs inspections to regulate those businesses.
