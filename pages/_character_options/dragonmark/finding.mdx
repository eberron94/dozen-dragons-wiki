The Mark of Finding bestows powers related to locating creatures or objects, making those who carry it useful as investigators or bounty hunters. In addition, members of the Finders Guild serve an essential role in locating dragonshards and selling them to other guilds for attunement.

**House**: House Tharashk is a family of half-orcs and humans originally from the region around the Shadow Marches. It controls the Finders Guild, which includes free lance inquisitives, some law enforcement agents, explorers-for-hire, and dragonshard prospectors. The Finders Guild concentrates its efforts in western Khorvaire, where a lucrative dragonshard prospecting business flourishes, although its members are found in every major town and city.
