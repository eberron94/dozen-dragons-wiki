The Mark of Healing grants curative magical powers.

**House**: The halflings of House Jorasco carry the Mark of Healing and operate the Healers Guild, which controls both the mundane and magical healing trades. A sick or injured person in Khorvaire is far more likely to seek healing from the Healers Guild than from any temple, and in fact most temples do not offer healing services for sale (though they still heal their own champions and faithful when necessary).

# Adept Spells

You may select from among the following dragonmark spells, that you can cast based on your level, when you gain the Dragonmark Adept feat. If the spell if from a different source, such as a class or archetype, it loses any associated traits and gains the arcane, dragonmark, adept, and {{node.name}} traits. Additionally, it gains the material component and requires the Least Dragonmark.
