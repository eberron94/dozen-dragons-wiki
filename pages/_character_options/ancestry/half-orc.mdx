Half-orcs are rare on Khorvaire, since humans and orcs have never lived in particularly close proximity. In the small, scattered human communities of the Shadow Marches, however, half-orcs are more common, and they can also be found in the western parts of the Eldeen Reaches and Droaam. The orcs of the Shadow Marches live much as the humans do: It is a rustic life, to be sure, but a far cry from their existence as ruthless barbarian hordes in the distant past. Half-orcs are just as civilized as the humans of the region, and often look almost human despite their size and strength.

Half-orcs can manifest the Mark of Finding, granting those who bear it abilities related to locating people and objects. The bloodlines that possess the dragonmark are part of House Tharashk.

### Appearance

Half-orc canine teeth often grow long enough to protrude from their mouths, and these "tusks," combined with heavy brows and slightly pointed ears, give them their notoriously bestial appearance.

### Names

As half-breeds, even ones who breed true, half-orcs have a variety of names. Those raised in human communities take human names typically. Those from orcish communities take orcish names. Those who live the half-blood tribes follow the naming convention of the region they're in. Those who bear the tainted blood and live in the Demon Wastes are called Sakah and they wear names of vile meaning like a cloak of skins.
