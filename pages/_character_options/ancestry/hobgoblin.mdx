# Heritages

You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

## Xaosbane Hobgoblin

Hobgoblins ruled an empire long ago and fought the daelkyr. Some hobgoblins retain an ancestral resistance to magic, which they refer to as xaos magic. You gain the Resist Xaos Magic reaction.

## Runtboss Hobgoblin

You come from a long line of hobgoblins who commanded goblins. You are smaller than other hobgoblins, but goblins still listen to any commands you bellow. You gain the Group Coercion skill feat. If you roll a success on an Intimidation check to Coerce a goblinoid, you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.

## Shortshanks Hobgoblin

You have a longer torso and broader shoulders than most hobgoblins, making your legs seem short by comparison. This gives you a strong, muscular core and lowers your center of gravity---features that assist you in riding and climbing---and you've trained at riding in a saddle from an extremely early age. You gain the Ride feat. Additionally, you are not flat-footed while you Climb.

## Smokeworker Hobgoblin

Your family have been alchemists, engineers, and scientists for generations, on projects bringing smoke and fire to the field of battle. You gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You automatically succeed at the DC 5 flat check to target a concealed creature if that creature is concealed only by smoke.

## Steelskin Hobgoblin

When you are cut or burned, your body responds by forming tough but flexible callouses over the site of the injury. Over time, this makes the most vulnerable sections of your body harder and more resistant to damage. Many steelskin hobgoblins intentionally use blades and flame to scar themselves in intricate patterns, though this isn't universal. Your flat check to recover from persistent physical (including bleed), energy, or poison damage is DC 13 (rather than DC 15), or DC 8 when provided particularly effective assistance.

## Warmarch Hobgoblin

You come from a line of wandering mercenaries, constantly on the march and scavenging food on the trail. If you fail, but not critically fail, to Subsist in the wilderness, you can still keep yourself fed with poor meals. When exploring, you can Hustle twice as long before you have to stop.

## Warrenbred Hobgoblin

Your ancestors lived underground. Your ears are larger than those of other hobgoblins and sensitive to echoes. When you are underground, you can use the Seek action to sense undetected creatures within a 30-foot burst instead of a 15-foot burst. In addition, if you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to Squeeze, you get a critical success instead.
