_There's no sight more beautiful to you than a strange brew bubbling in a beaker, and you consume your ingenious elixirs with abandon. You're fascinated by uncovering the secrets of science and the natural world, and you're constantly experimenting in your lab or on the go with inventive concoctions for every eventuality. You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. Your unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits._

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Intelligence

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your Intelligence.

**Hit Points** 8 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see the following key terms in many alchemist abilities.

**Additive** Feats with the additive trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances to bombs or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically use actions with the additive trait only when you're creating an infused alchemical item, and some can be used only with the Quick Alchemy action. The additive trait is always followed by a level, such as additive 2. An additive adds its level to the level of the alchemical item you're modifying; the result is the new level of the mixture. The mixture's item level must be no higher than your advanced alchemy level.

**Infused** You created an alchemical item with the infused trait using your infused reagents, and it has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any nonpermanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again.

## In Combat

Each day you can choose to spend your infused reagents to quickly create alchemical items, best suited to your current needs. Or you can plan ahead to create a larger number of alchemical items and hand them out to the party.

# Proficiencies

You are trained in Crafting and a number of additional skills equal to 3 plus your Intelligence modifier.

# Class Features

As an alchemist, you gain the following class feature and sub-class features at the listed level. Additionally, at 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain an alchemist class feat.

{{{featureClass "Alchemy" level=1}}}

You understand the complex interactions of natural and unnatural substances and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use special infused reagents that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of, them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.

You gain the {{{ref "feat.skill.crb.alchemical-crafting"}}} feat, even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four common 1st-level alchemical formulas granted by that feat. You can use this feat to create alchemical items as long as you have the items' formulas in your formula book.

{{{card "feat.skill.crb.alchemical-crafting"}}}

#### Infused Reagents

You infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence, allowing you to create alchemical items at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you gain a number of batches of infused reagents equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use these reagents for either advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy, described below. Together, these infused reagents have light Bulk.

As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infused reagents from the previous day's preparations are instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day's infused items immediately end. While infused reagents are physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than your daily preparations. Any such artificial reagents lack the infusion and are useless for advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy.

#### Advanced Alchemy

During your daily preparations, after producing new infused reagents, you can spend batches of those infused reagents to create infused alchemical items. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical reagent requirements. Your advanced alchemy level is equal to your level. For each batch of infused reagents you spend, choose an alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book, and make a batch of two of that item. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.

#### Quick Alchemy

If you need a specific alchemical item on the fly, you can use your infused reagents to quickly create it with the Quick Alchemy action.

{{{card "action.class.alchemist.crb.quick-alchemy"}}}

{{{featureClass "Formula Book" level=1 altered=true}}}

An alchemist keeps meticulous records of the formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard formula book worth 10 sp or less for free. The formula book contains the formulas for four common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to those you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field. Alchemical Items can be found here.

Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for three common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to invent them with the Inventor feat.

{{{featureClass "Research Field" level=1}}}

Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. You might have a degree from a scientific institute, correspond with other researchers in your field, or work as a genius loner. Choose a field of research.

Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formula book; these are your signature items. When using a batch of infused reagents to create your signature items using advanced alchemy, you create three items instead of two. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research field's list of possible signature items.

Research fields can be found [here](/class/alchemist/research-fields.html)

{{{featureClass "Alchemical Discovery" level=3 altered=true}}}

At 3rd level you become an expert in Crafting. At 7th level, you become a master in Crafting, and at 15th level, you become Legendary in Crafting.

{{{featureClass "Powerful Alchemy" level=5 altered=true}}}

Infused alchemical items you create on the fly are particularly potent. When you use Advanced Alchemy or Quick Alchemy to create an infused alchemical item that allows a saving throw, you can change its DC to your class DC if it's higher.

{{{featureClass "Double Brew" level=9 altered=true}}}

You know your formulas so well that you can concoct two items at once. When using the Quick Alchemy action, instead of spending one batch of infused reagents to create a single item, you can spend up to two batches of infused reagents to make up to two alchemical items as described in that action. These items do not have to be the same.

Additionally, infused items created with Quick Alchemy remain potent until the end of your next turn.

{{{featureClass "Juggernaut" level=9}}}

When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=13}}}

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Alchemical Alacrity" level=15 altered=true}}}

Your comfort in concocting items is such that you can create three at a time. When using the Quick Alchemy action, you can spend up to three batches of infused reagents to make up to three alchemical items as described in that action. These items do not have to be the same, and you automatically stow one of these new items as you create them.

Additionally, infused items created with Quick Alchemy remain potent for 1 minute.

{{{featureClass "Evasion" level=15}}}

You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.
