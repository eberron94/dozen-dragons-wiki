_The power of nature is impossible to resist. It can bring ruin to the stoutest fortress in minutes, reducing even the mightiest works to rubble, burning them to ash, burying them beneath an avalanche of snow, or drowning them beneath the waves. It can provide endless bounty and breathtaking splendor to those who respect it--- and an agonizing death to those who take it too lightly. You are one of those who hear nature's call. You stand in awe of the majesty of its power and give yourself over to its service._

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Wisdom

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Wisdom.

**Hit Points** 8 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see the following key terms in many druid class features.

**Metamagic** Actions with the metamagic trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself.

## In Combat

You call upon the forces of nature to defeat your enemies and protect your allies. You cast spells that draw upon primal magic to protect yourself and your friends, heal their wounds, or summon deadly animals to fight at your side. Depending on your bond to nature, you might call upon powerful elemental magic or change shape into a terrifying beast.

# Proficiencies

You are trained in Nature, a skill determined by your order, and a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier.

## Perception & Offense

| Proficiencies          | Trained     | Expert     | Master     | Legendary  |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |

| Primal Spell Tradition | _1st level_ | 7th level  | 15th level | 19th level |
| Simple Weapons         | _1st level_ | 11th level | ---        | ---        |
| Unarmed Attacks        | _1st level_ | 11th level | ---        | ---        |

## Armor Class

| Proficiencies | Trained     | Expert     | Master | Legendary |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ | --------- |
| Unarmored     | _1st level_ | 13th level | ---    | ---       |
| Light Armor   | _1st level_ | 13th level | ---    | ---       |

## Saving Throws

| Proficiencies | Trained     | Expert      | Master        | Legendary |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Fortitude     | _1st level_ | 5th level   | ---           | ---       |
| Reflex        | _1st level_ | 3rd level   | ---           | ---       |
| Will          | ---         | _1st level_ | 11th level^+^ | ---       |

**+** When you roll a success with this save, you get a critical success instead.

# Class Features

As a druid, you gain the following class feature and sub-class features at the listed level. Additionally, at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a druid class feat.

{{{featureClass "Druidic Order" level=1 altered=true}}}

Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders.

Orders can be found [here](/class/druid/orders.html).

#### The Language of Druids

You know and can speak Vvark, a secret language known only to druids, in addition to any languages you know.

#### Anathema

As stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. If you perform enough acts that are anathema to nature, you lose your magical abilities that come from the druid class, including your primal spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual.

The following acts are anathema to all druids:

-   Using metal armor or shields.
-   Despoiling natural places.
-   Teaching the Vvark language to non-druids.

Each druidic order also has additional anathema acts, detailed in the order's entry.

{{{featureClass "Primal Prepared Spellcasting" level=1}}}

The power of the wild world flows through you. You can cast primal spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells). Because you're a druid, you can usually hold a primal focus (such as holly and mistletoe) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a material component pouch.

Each day, you can prepare a number of spells and cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list or from other primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a druid, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase.

Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Rolls.

| Level | Cantrips | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th |
| ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |

| 17    | 5        | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | ---  |
| 18    | 5        | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | ---  |
| 19    | 5        | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 1^†^ |
| 20    | 5        | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 1^†^ |

**†** The primal hierophant class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.

#### Heightening Spells

When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.

#### Cantrips

Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up---this is usually equal to the highest level of druid spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level druid, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.

{{{featureClass "Order Spells (Focus Spells)" level=1 altered=true}}}

Your time with the druidic order has taught you to draw on the primal power around you, called order spells. Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots to cast, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Selecting druid feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells are found here.

{{{featureClass "Shield Block" level=1}}}

You gain the {{{ref "feat.general.crb.shield-block"}}} general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.

{{{card "feat.general.crb.shield-block"}}}

{{{featureClass "Wild Empathy" level=1}}}

You have a connection to the creatures of the natural world that allows you to communicate with them on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on animals and to make very simple Requests of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to make your case.

{{{featureClass "Resolve" level=11}}}

You've steeled your mind with resolve. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=13}}}

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.
