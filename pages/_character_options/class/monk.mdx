_The strength of your fist flows from your mind and spirit. You seek perfection---honing your body into a flawless instrument and your mind into an orderly bastion of wisdom. You're a fierce combatant renowned for martial arts skills and combat stances that grant you unique fighting moves. While the challenge of mastering many fighting styles drives you to great heights, you also enjoy meditating on philosophical questions and discovering new ways to obtain peace and enlightenment._

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Strength or Dexterity

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.

**Hit Points** 10 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see the following key terms in many monk abilities.

**Flourish** Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Incapacitation** An ability with this trait can take a character out of the fight. But when you use an incapacitation effect against a creature of higher level than you, you reduce the degree of success of your attack roll by one step, and that creature improves the degree of success of its saving throws for that effect by one step.

**Stance** A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you take an action that has the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.

## In Combat

You speed into the fray, dodging or leaping past obstacles with acrobatic maneuvers. You strike opponents in a rapid flurry of attacks, using your bare fists or wielding specialized weapons that you mastered during your monastic training. Stances let you change up your combat style for different situations, and ki abilities allow you to perform mystic feats like healing yourself and soaring through the air.

# Proficiencies

You are trained in a number of skills equal to 4 plus your Intelligence modifier.

**Special** At 7th and 11th level you choose a save to gain master proficiency. At 15th level, you choose a save with master proficiency and you gain legendary proficiency with it. See Path to Perfection, Second Path to Perfection, and Third Path to Perfection for more details.

**+** When you roll a success with this save, you get a critical success instead.

**++** When you roll a critical failure with this save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure with this save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.

# Class Features

As a monk, you gain the following class feature at the listed level. Additionally, at 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a monk class feat.

{{{featureClass "Powerful Fist" level=1}}}

You know how to wield your fists as deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4. Most people take a -2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with nonlethal unarmed attacks, because they find it hard to use their fists with deadly force. You don't take this penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks.

{{{featureClass "Flurry of Blows" level=1}}}

You can attack rapidly with fists, feet, elbows, knees, and other unarmed attacks. You gain the {{{ref "action.class.monk.crb.flurry-of-blows"}}} action.

{{{card "action.class.monk.crb.flurry-of-blows"}}}

{{{featureClass "Ki Spells" level=1}}}

**Special** This class feature is only granted when you gain a monk feat that grants a ki spell.

By tapping into a supernatural inner reserve called ki, you can create magical effects. Certain feats grant you special spells called ki spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first ki spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to meditate in order to reach inner peace.

When you first gain a ki spell, decide whether your ki spells are divine spells or occult spells. You become trained in spell attacks and spell DCs of that tradition and your key spellcasting ability is Wisdom.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear here.

{{{featureClass "Incredible Movement" level=3}}}

You move like the wind. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed whenever you're not wearing armor. The bonus increases by 5 feet for every 4 levels you have beyond 3rd.

| Speed        | 3rd level | 7th level | 11th level | 15th level | 19th level |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| status bonus | +10-foot  | +15-foot  | +20-foot   | +25-foot   | +30-foot   |

{{{featureClass "Mystic Strikes" level=3}}}

Focusing your will into your physical attacks imbues them with mystical energy. Your unarmed attacks become magical, allowing them to get past resistances to non-magical attacks.

<!-- However, you still need an item such as handwraps of mighty blows to gain an item bonus to attack rolls or increase your attacks' weapon damage dice. -->

{{{featureClass "Path to Perfection" level=3}}}

You have progressed along your own path to enlightenment. Choose your Fortitude, Reflex, or Will saving throw. Your proficiency rank for the chosen saving throw increases to master. When you roll a success on the chosen saving throw, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=7}}}

Your rage helps you hit harder. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Metal Strikes" level=9}}}

You can adjust your body to make unarmed attacks infused with the mystic energy of rare metals. Your unarmed attacks are treated as cold iron and silver. This allows you to deal more damage to a variety of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.

{{{featureClass "Second Path to Perfection" level=11}}}

You've learned to find perfection in every success. Choose a different saving throw than the one you chose for your Path to Perfection. Your proficiency rank for the chosen saving throw increases to master. If you roll a success with the chosen saving throw, you instead critically succeed.

{{{featureClass "Greater Weapon Specialization" level=15}}}

The weapons you've mastered become truly fearsome in your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Third Path to Perfection" level=15}}}

You have made great progress in your personal studies of enlightenment. Choose one of the saving throws you selected for Path to Perfection or second Path to Perfection. Your proficiency rank for the chosen type of save increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on the chosen type of save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on the chosen type of save against an effect that deals damage, you take half damage.

{{{featureClass "Adamantine Strikes" level=17}}}

When you focus your will into your limbs, your blows are as unyielding as the hardest of metals. Your unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine.

{{{featureClass "Perfected Form" level=19}}}

You have purged incompetence from your techniques. On your first Strike of your turn, if you roll lower than 10, you can treat the attack roll as a 10. This is a fortune effect.
