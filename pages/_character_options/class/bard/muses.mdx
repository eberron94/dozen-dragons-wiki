As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things, and might be a physical creature, a deity, a philosophy, or a captivating mystery.

# Enigma Muse

Your muse is a mystery, driving you to uncover the hidden secrets of the multiverse. If your muse is a creature, it might be a dragon or otherworldly being; if a deity, it might be the Traveller. You gain the {{{ref "feat.class.bard.crb.bardic-lore"}}} feat and add {{{ref "spell.slot::.true-strike"}}} to your spell repertoire.

# Maestro Muse

Your muse is a virtuoso, inspiring you to greater heights. If it's a creature, it might be a performance-loving creature such as a choral angel; if a deity, it might be Olladra. As a bard with a maestro muse, you are an inspiration to your allies and confident of your musical and oratorical abilities. You gain the {{{ref "feat.class.bard.crb.lingering-composition"}}} feat and add {{{ref "spell.slot::.soothe"}}} to your spell repertoire.

{{{card "feat.class.bard.crb.lingering-composition"}}}

{{{card "spell.slot::.soothe"}}}

# Polymath

Your muse is a jack of all trades, flitting between skills and pursuits. If it's is a creature, it might be an eclectic creature like a fey; if a deity, it might be Boldrei. As a bard with a polymath muse, you are interested in a wide array of topics but rarely dedicated to any one, and you rarely make up your mind---you want to try everything. You gain the {{{ref "feat.class.bard.crb.versatile-performance"}}} feat and add {{{ref "spell.slot::.unseen-servant"}}} to your spell repertoire.

# Warrior

The battlefield is your stage, the clang of steel, your song. Your muse engages in countless battles, whether reveling in combat or resigned to its necessity. If your muse is a creature, it might be an otherworldly soldier. If it's a deity, it might be Dol Dorn or the Lord of Blades. As a bard with a warrior muse, you train for battle in addition to performance, and you prepare your allies for the dangers of battle. You might even wade into the thick of things with them. You gain the {{{ref "feat.class.bard.apg.martial-performance"}}} feat and add {{{ref "spell.slot::.fear"}}} to your spell repertoire.
