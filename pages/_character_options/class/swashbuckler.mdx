_Many warriors rely on brute force, weighty armor, or cumbersome weapons. For you, battle is a dance where you move among foes with style and grace. You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair._

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Dexterity

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity.

**Hit Points** 10 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see these terms in many swashbuckler abilities.

**Finisher** Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that use your panache. You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn. Some actions with the finisher trait also grant an effect on a failure. Effects added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.

**Flourish** Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Stance** A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in that stance for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.

## In Combat

You show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your swashbuckler's style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them.

# Proficiencies

You are trained in Acrobatics, one skill determined by your swashbuckler's style, and a number of additional skills equal to 4 plus your Intelligence modifier.

**++** When you roll a critical failure with this save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure with this save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.

# Class Features

As a swashbuckler, you gain the following class feature at the listed level. Additionally, at 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a swashbuckler class feat.

{{{featureClass "Swashbuckler's Style" level=1}}}

As a swashbuckler, you have your own distinctive style that enables you to gracefully handle everyday events and life-or- death situations alike. Choose a swashbuckler's style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action.

A list of all swashbuckler's styles can be found below.

{{{featureClass "Panache" level=1}}}

You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a state of panache or you are not.

You gain panache by successfully performing the skill check associated with specific actions that have a bit of flair, including Tumble Through and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style. At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold).

While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache. Powerful finisher actions, including Confident Finisher can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache.

Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.

{{{featureClass "Precise Strike" level=1}}}

You strike with flair. When you have panache and you Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.

As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. Increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike and the number of additional dice on a finisher by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.

| Damage         | 1st level | 5th level | 9th level | 13th level | 17th level |
| -------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| panache bonus  | +2        | +3        | +4        | +5         | +6         |
| finisher bonus | +2d6      | +3d6      | +4d6      | +5d6       | +6d6       |

{{{featureClass "Confident Finisher" level=1}}}

You gain an elegant finishing attack you can make when you have panache. You gain the Confident Finisher action.

{{{card "action.class.swashbuckler.apg.confident-finisher"}}}

{{{featureClass "Opportune Riposte" level=3}}}

You turn the tables on foes who fumble, capitalizing immediately on their mistake. You gain the Opportune Riposte reaction.

{{{card "action.class.swashbuckler.apg.opportune-riposte"}}}

{{{featureClass "Stylish Tricks" level=3}}}

At 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you gain a skill feat. This feat must be for Acrobatics or the trained skill from your swashbuckler's style.

{{{featureClass "Vivacious Speed" level=3}}}

When you've made an impression, you move even faster than normal, darting about the battlefield with incredible speed. Increase the status bonus to your Speeds when you have panache to a +10-foot status bonus; this bonus increases by 5 feet at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. When you don't have panache, you still get half this status bonus to your Speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment.

| Speed        | 3rd level | 7th level | 11th level | 15th level | 19th level |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| status bonus | +10-foot  | +15-foot  | +20-foot   | +25-foot   | +30-foot   |

{{{featureClass "Critical Weapon" level=5}}}

You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all weapons for which you have expert proficiency.

{{{featureClass "Evasion" level=7}}}

You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=7}}}

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Continuous Flair" level=11}}}

While not equal to the heights of your panache in combat, you have a dramatic flair about you in any situation. Whenever you succeed at a check during exploration that would have granted you panache in combat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to further checks for actions that would grant you panache in combat. This benefit ends when the exploration changes to a different scene (as determined by the GM) or shifts to an encounter or downtime.

{{{featureClass "Improved Evasion" level=13}}}

Your ability to elude danger is matchless. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.

{{{featureClass "Greater Weapon Specialization" level=15}}}

The weapons you've mastered become truly fearsome in your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Keen Flair" level=15}}}

You inflict particularly devastating attacks on even well-defended foes. When you Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack with which you have master proficiency, if you roll a 19 on the die and the roll is a success, you critically succeed instead.

{{{featureClass "Resolve" level=17}}}

You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Eternal Confidence" level=17}}}

As a swashbuckler at the peak of your skill, you swell with confidence and bravado in every attack. When you Strike as part of a finisher or Opportune Riposte, you can give the Strike the failure effect from the Confident Finisher action, including the increase from Precise Finisher if you have that feat. You can do so only if the Strike uses a weapon or unarmed attack that you could use for Confident Finisher.
