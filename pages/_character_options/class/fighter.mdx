_Fighting for honor, greed, loyalty, or simply the thrill of battle, you are an undisputed master of weaponry and combat techniques. You combine your actions through clever combinations of opening moves, finishing strikes, and counterattacks whenever your foes are unwise enough to drop their guard. Whether you are a knight, mercenary, sharpshooter, or blade master, you have honed your martial skills into an art form and perform devastating critical attacks on your enemies._

# Mechanics

**Key Ability** Strength or Dexterity

At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.

**Hit Points** 10 + Constitution modifier

You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.

## Key Terms

You'll see the following key terms in many fighter class features.

**Flourish** Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Open** These maneuvers work only as the first salvo in the attacks you make on your turn. You can use an action with the open trait only if you haven't used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.

**Press** Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.

Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)

**Stance** A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you take an action with the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.

## In Combat

You strike with unmatched accuracy and use specialized combat techniques. A melee fighter stands between allies and enemies, attacking foes who try to get past. A ranged fighter delivers precise shots from a distance.

# Proficiencies

You are trained in your choice of Acrobatics or Athletics and a number of additional skills equal to 3 plus your Intelligence modifier.

# Class Features

As a fighter, you gain the following class feature at the listed level. Additionally, at 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a fighter class feat.

{{{featureClass "Attack of Opportunity" level=1}}}

Ever watchful for weaknesses, you can quickly attack foes that leave an opening in their defenses. You gain the Attack of Opportunity reaction.

{{{card "action.class.fighter.crb.attack-of-opportunity"}}}

{{{featureClass "Shield Block" level=1}}}

You gain the {{{ref "feat.general.crb.shield-block"}}} general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.

{{{card "feat.general.crb.shield-block"}}}

{{{featureClass "Bravery" level=3}}}

Having faced countless foes and the chaos of battle, you have learned how to stand strong in the face of fear and keep on fighting. When you roll a success at a Will save against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. In addition, anytime you gain the frightened condition, reduce its value by 1.

{{{featureClass "Fighter Weapon Mastery" level=5 altered=true}}}

Hours spent training with your preferred weapons, learning and developing new combat techniques, have made you particularly effective with your weapons of choice. Choose one weapon group. Your proficiency rank increases to master with the simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks in that group, and to expert with the advanced weapons in that group.

{{{featureClass "Critical Weapon" level=5 altered=true}}}

Your precision with certain weapons makes them incredibly lethal. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all weapons and unarmed attacks for which you have master proficiency.

{{{featureClass "Battlefield Surveyor" level=5}}}

Whether taking stock of an enemy army or simply standing guard, you excel at observing your foes. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks for initiative, making you faster to react during combat.

{{{featureClass "Weapon Specialization" level=7}}}

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Combat Flexibility" level=9}}}

Through your experience in battle, you can prepare your tactics to suit different situations. When you make your daily preparations, you gain one fighter feat of 8th level or lower that you don't already have. You can use that feat until your next daily preparations. You must meet all of the feat's other prerequisites.

{{{featureClass "Juggernaut" level=9}}}

Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Armor Specialization" level=11}}}

You have spent so much time in armor that you know how to make the most of its protection. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.

{{{featureClass "Fighter Weapon Legend" level=13}}}

You've learned fighting techniques that apply to all armaments, and you've developed unparalleled skill with your favorite weapons. You can select one weapon group and increase your proficiency ranks to legendary for all simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks in that weapon group, and to master for all advanced weapons in that weapon group.

The weapon group can be the same as Fighter Weapon Mastery or you can choose a new group.

{{{featureClass "Evasion" level=15}}}

You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.

{{{featureClass "Greater Weapon Specialization" level=15}}}

The weapons you've mastered become truly fearsome in your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

{{{featureClass "Improved Flexibility" level=15}}}

Your extensive experience gives you even greater ability to adapt to each day's challenges. When you use combat flexibility, you can gain two fighter feats instead of one. While the first feat must still be 8th level or lower, the second feat can be up to 14th level, and you can use the first feat to meet the prerequisites of the second feat. You must meet all of the feats' prerequisites.
