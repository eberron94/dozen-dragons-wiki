Druidic orders define how you draw strength from nature. They grant you a class feat and training with a skill as well as an order spell.

# Order of the Animal

You have a strong connection to beasts, and you are allied with a beast companion.

-   You are trained in Athletics
-   You gain the {{{ref "feat.class.druid.crb.animal-companion"}}} druid feat
-   You gain the {{{ref "spell.focus.1st.crb.heal-animal"}}} order spell

{{{card "feat.class.druid.crb.animal-companion"}}}

{{{card "spell.focus.1st.crb.heal-animal"}}}

{{{featureClass "Anathema" level=1 id='animal'}}}

-   Committing wanton cruelty to animals or killing animals unnecessarily is anathema to your order (this doesn't prevent you from defending yourself against animals or killing them cleanly for food).

# Order of the Flame

You feel a kinship with flames and can use them for succor and destruction.

-   You're trained in Acrobatics
-   You gain the {{{ref "feat.class.druid.som.fire-lung"}}} druid feat

{{{card "spell.focus.1st.som.wildfire"}}}

{{{featureClass "Anathema" level=1 id='flame'}}}

-   Allowing unnatural fires to spread or preventing natural fires from occurring in a way that harms the environment are anathema to your order (this doesn't prevent you from using fire destructively or force you to combat a controlled or natural fire).

# Order of the Leaves

You revere plants and the bounty of nature, acting as both a gardener and warden for the wilderness, teaching sustainable techniques to communities, and helping areas regrow after disasters or negligent humanoid expansion.

-   You are trained in Diplomacy
-   You gain the {{{ref "feat.class.druid.crb.leshy-familiar"}}} druid feat

{{{card "spell.focus.1st.crb.goodberry"}}}

{{{featureClass "Anathema" level=1 id='leaf'}}}

-   Committing wanton cruelty to plants or killing plants unnecessarily is anathema to your order (this doesn't prevent you from defending yourself against plants or harvesting them when necessary for survival).

# Order of the Stones

You're as enduring as stone, and you take comfort in its steadfast presence, both natural and worked.

-   You're trained in Crafting
-   You gain the {{{ref "feat.class.druid.som.steadying-stone"}}} druid feat
-   You gain the {{{ref "spell.focus.1st.som.crushing-ground"}}} order spell

{{{card "spell.focus.1st.som.crushing-ground"}}}

{{{featureClass "Anathema" level=1 id='stone'}}}

-   Poisoning or polluting the land and heedlessly carving the earth to plunder its natural resources are anathema to your order (this doesn't prevent you from responsibly digging or mining).

# Order of the Storm

You carry the fury of the storm within you, channeling it to terrifying effect and riding the winds through the sky.

-   You are trained in Acrobatics
-   You gain the {{{ref "feat.class.druid.crb.storm-born"}}} druid feat
-   You gain the {{{ref "spell.focus.1st.crb.tempest-surge"}}} order spell

{{{card "spell.focus.1st.crb.tempest-surge"}}}

{{{featureClass "Anathema" level=1 id='storm'}}}

-   Polluting the air or allowing those who cause major air pollution or climate shifts to go unpunished is anathema to your order. (This doesn't force you to take action against merely potential harm to the environment or to sacrifice yourself against an obviously superior foe.)

# Order of the Waves

Water is the source of life, and you've learned to shape how it flows.

-   You're trained in Medicine
-   You gain the {{{ref "feat.class.druid.som.shore-step"}}} druid feat

{{{card "spell.focus.1st.som.rising-surf"}}}

{{{featureClass "Anathema" level=1 id='wave'}}}

-   Polluting water or allowing those who pollute water sources to go unpunished is anathema to your order (this doesn't force you to take action against potential water pollution or to sacrifice yourself against an obviously superior foe).

# Order of the Wild

The savage, uncontrollable call of the natural world infuses you, granting you the ability to change your shape and take on the ferocious form of a wild creature.

-   You are trained in Intimidation
-   You gain the {{{ref "feat.class.druid.crb.wild-shape"}}} druid feat
-   You gain the {{{ref "spell.focus.1st.crb.wild-morph"}}} order spell

{{{card "feat.class.druid.crb.wild-shape"}}}

{{{card "spell.focus.1st.crb.wild-shape"}}}

{{{card "spell.focus.1st.crb.wild-morph"}}}

{{{featureClass "Anathema" level=1 id='wild'}}}

-   Becoming fully domesticated by the temptations of civilization is anathema to your order. (This doesn't prevent you from buying and using processed goods or staying in a city for an adventure, but you can never come to rely on these conveniences or truly call such a place your permanent home.)
