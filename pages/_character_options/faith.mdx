Religion plays an important role in Eberron. The gods don't manifest physically, but people of faith believe that divine forces shape everyday life. Shared beliefs unite communities and can provide hope in difficult times.

Most Khorvairians acknowledge the pantheon of the Sovereign Host and its malign shadow, the Dark Six. The Sovereign Host was the dominant faith of the Kingdom of Galifar and holds sway over most of Khorvaire---except for Thrane, which favors the Church of the Silver Flame. Other religions connect specific cultures or communities; the kalashtar observe the Path of Light, and the Undying Court guides the elves of Aerenal.

Religion is especially important for a champion, cleric, or druid, yet any character can have faith in a higher power. Following a religion is a way to give your character a deeper connection to the world and a bond to other members of the community.

# Creating a Divine Feature Package

Eberron's divine magic is based on faith in something, even if that something is not a fully realized deity. This does not perfectly translate to Pathfinder, which has discrete deities, each with their own list of benefits. To solve this, when you first choose a class or feature that uses faith, you will work with the GM to create a custom Divine Feature package.

Eberron is mostly a pantheon-based system of faith, which does not translate perfectly to Pathfinder. When you first choose class features that rely on your faith, you will work with the GM to create a custom Divine Feature package. You will need to choose for each of the following:

## Areas of Concern & Edicts

Whether your faith is part of an organized religion or not, your conviction needs a cornerstone. Without it, you are no different from the faithless. That cornerstone is your Areas of Concern and Edicts. These can match up with a religion, allowing you to use the examples below, or a more personal set of tenants you follow.

**Areas of Concern** Choose three words or a short phrase to describe what you care and believe in. For example, the Silver Flame is concerned with protecting people from evil. So a follower could have their Area of Concern be "eradicate evil" or "inspire, guide, defend."

**Edicts** Simple rules that you follow to reinforce your beliefs. See the examples for the common pantheons.

Your Areas of Concern and Edicts are for roleplaying, so make sure they fit with your life as an adventurer. If you worship a pantheon or specific deity, be sure to take into account their influences.

## Divine Font (Cleric)

Clerics channel divine power as a font of negative or positive energy in the form of the {{{ref "spell.slot.1st.crb.harm"}}} or {{{ref "spell.slot.1st.crb.heal"}}} spells. Consider your Areas of Concern and Edicts, a faith based on defending the weak could use heal to help the injured or smite the wicked.

## Divine Skill (Cleric, Champion)

Champions and clerics gain trained proficiency with a skill based on their faith. Your Areas of Concern should influence this choice.

## Favored Weapon (Cleric)

Clerics gain access to their faith's favored weapon as well as the trained proficiency rank with it; warpriest gain additional benefits. Every faith has a favored weapon, yours should thematically fit with your Edicts.

## Domains

Each faith grants you two of domains that reflect your Areas of Concern. Champions, clerics, and druid can learn the domain spells from their faith's domains. You can change these later as your understanding of your faith evolves, but that will happen as part of roleplay.

The list of domains, and the spells they grant can be found on the next page.

## Cleric Spells (Cleric)

The GM will add a number of spells to your available list based on your Areas of Concern and Edicts.
