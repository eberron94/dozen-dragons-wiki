This is a quick overview of the basics of the game. Don't worry about this too much, learning by example is better than reading for gameplay.

# Rolling Dice

> d20 + skill proficiency + ability modifier + potency + (circumstance bonus + circumstance penalty) + (status bonus + status penalty)

Most rolls will use a d20, these are skill checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. You add the following to the d20:

-   **Proficiency** your proficiency is determined by various features. It has a value of +2 for _trained_, +4 for _expert_, +6 for _master_, and +8 for _legendary_.
-   **Ability Modifier** you add of the six ability modifier and it usually has a value between -1 to +6.
-   **Potency** a bonus determined by your level, added only to proficient rolls. It has a value of +1 at 4th level, +2 at 10th level, and +3 at 16th level.
-   **Circumstance** the best bonus and worst penalty circumstance values are added to a roll. Applied by circumstantial things, like being prone or raising a shield.
-   **Status** the best bonus and worst penalty status values are added to a roll. Applied by supernatural forces.

A roll is successful when it beats the Difficulty Class, DC for short. If the roll is 10 points greater than the DC, it is instead a critical success, which has enhanced results for you. If the roll is less than the DC, you have a failure, or a critical failure if you failed by 10 points.

You record the sum of the _proficiency_, _ability modifier_, and _potency_ for all skills, attacks, and saving throws for quick reference. This is called your final value for that statistic.

# Determining AC and other DCs

A DC is used when another creature attempts to oppose you on something. The most common DC is Armor Class, AC for short, and is referenced whenever something makes an attack roll against you.

Your AC is equal to 10 plus the following:

-   **Proficiency with your worn armor** your proficiency is determined by your class. It has a value of +2 for _trained_, +4 for _expert_, +6 for _master_, and +8 for _legendary_.
-   **Worn armor's item bonus** the armor you wear gives a bonus between +0 and +6. See your armor's statistics.
-   **Dexterity modifier** your Dexterity modifier, but only if it is a positive value. Some armor will limit the Dexterity bonus.
-   **Potency** a bonus determined by your level. It has a value of +1 at 4th level, +2 at 10th level, and +3 at 16th level.
-   **Other modifiers** AC can be altered by circumstance and status values.

> AC = 10 + worn armor proficiency + armor item bonus + Dexterity modifier [capped by armor] + potency + circumstance and status values

You will also need to know the DC of certain character features. The most common is Class DC and Spellcasting DC. For all cases, you add 10 to the final value. For example, your Reflex DC is 10 plus your Reflex final value.

> DC = 10 + final value of statistic
