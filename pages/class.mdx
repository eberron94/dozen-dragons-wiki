Each class gains a number of class features over its career. A class feature entry starts with its name on the left and the level you gain it on the right. If the entry has a dagger (â€ ) next to the level, it has been modified by GM homebrew.

# Explaining Class Entries

Before jumping into the classes, this page will explain what the various terms mean.

## Key Ability

Key ability is the ability score that a member of your class cares about the most. Many of your most useful and powerful abilities are tied to this ability in some way. Your class DC is determined by your key ability and if you are a spellcasting class, your spell DC likely uses it.

Most classes are associated with one key ability score, but some allow you to choose from two options. For instance, if you're a fighter, you can choose either Strength or Dexterity as your key ability. A fighter who chooses Strength will excel in brutal hand-to-hand combat, while those who choose Dexterity prefer ranged or finesse weapons.

Additionally, when you choose your character's class, they gain an ability boost to their key ability score, increasing that ability score by 2. For more about ability boosts, Step 5 of character creation.

## Proficiency

When you choose your character's class, they gain a set of initial proficiencies. Proficiencies measure your character's ability to perform tasks, use abilities, and succeed at checks. Proficiency ranks range from trained to legendary. For instance, a character who is trained with a longbow can use it effectively, while a person who is legendary with the weapon might be able to split an arrow from 100 paces away!

Each class entry specifies your character's initial proficiency rank in Perception, saving throws, attacks, defenses, and either spells or class DC. You gain the trained proficiency rank in several skills---the exact number depends on your class, and some classes specify certain additional skills that you're trained in. If your class would make you trained in a skill you're already trained in (typically due to your background), you can select another skill to become trained in.

A proficiency rank can unlock various feats and class features, and it also helps determine the modifier for any check you roll or DC you calculate related to that statistic. If your character is trained in Perception, a saving throw, or another statistic, they gain a proficiency bonus equal to + 2. See below for all proficiency ranks.

| Proficiencies | Bonus |
| ------------- | ----- |
| Trained       | +2    |
| Expert        | +4    |
| Master        | +6    |
| Legendary     | +8    |

Spellcasting classes grant a proficiency rank for spell attacks and DCs, which are further detailed in each class's entry.

If something isn't listed in your character's class entry, their proficiency rank in that statistic is untrained unless they gain training from another source. If your character is untrained in something, you add a proficiency bonus of +0 when attempting a check or calculating a DC related to that statistic.

## Class DC and Spellcasting DC

Class DC and spellcasting DC determine the difficulty of certain class abilities. Both DCs are calculated the same: DC = 10 + your proficiency bonus for the DC + your key ability score modifier.

## Perception

Perception measures your ability to be aware of your environment. You use it to find something hidden, determine when you are being lied to, and figure out who goes first during combat.

# Restricted Classes

The nature of the setting, the planned campaign, and the GM's time maintain this wiki and other tools has put a soft restriction on certain classes. If you wish to play any of these classes, contact the GM to discuss options.

**[Gunslinger](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=20)** Eberron does not have firearms. The Gunslinger can be reflavored as a Wandslinger or just use a crossbow, but the extensive rewriting is beyond the scope of this wiki. If you wish to play a Wandslinger or a Crossbow Ace, contact the GM to discuss options.

**[Investigator](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=13)** The Investigator focuses on mysteries and intrigue, which the currently planned campaign does not feature heavily. As a result, this class would not see its full potential. If you wish to play an Investigator, contact the GM to discuss options.

**[Psychic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=21)** A very new class, so the GM has not had time to read into it and the automatic card generator might be missing some feats. Additionally, Eberron's psionics are mostly focused on the kalashtar which will not feature much in the campaign. If you wish to play a Psychic, contact the GM to discuss options.

**[Summoner](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=18)** A relatively complex class which cannot be easily displayed in this wiki. There is no real restriction, but you will have to read up on the class from Archives of Nethys.

**[Thaumaturge](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=22)** A very new class, so the GM has not had time to read into it and the automatic card generator might be missing some feats. If you wish to play a Thaumaturge, contact the GM to discuss options.
