Spellhearts are made from the same basic materials as talismans, though their complex construction—magically iterated around the concept of a single kind of spell—gives them a variety of additional powers and means they persist rather than burning out when used.

Unlike talismans, a spellheart can be used repeatedly, and doesn't burn out after use. Each spellheart can be attached to different items, giving a benefit depending on your choice, which means you can plan ahead in facing expected dangers. They have the spellheart trait.
