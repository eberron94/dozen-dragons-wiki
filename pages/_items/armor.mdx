Armor increases your character's defenses, but some medium or heavy armor can hamper movement. If you want to increase your character's defense beyond the protection your armor provides, they can use a shield. Armor protects your character only while they're wearing it.

### Donning and Removing Armor

Getting in and out of armor is time consuming—so make sure you're wearing it when you need it! Donning and removing armor are both activities involving many Interact actions. It takes 1 minute to don light armor, 5 minutes to don medium or heavy armor, and 1 minute to remove any armor.

### Armor Statistics

Armor sets have the following statistics:

**Category**: The armor's category—unarmored, light armor, medium armor, or heavy armor—indicates which proficiency bonus you use while wearing the armor.

**AC Bonus**: This number is the item bonus you add for the armor when determining Armor Class.

**Dexterity Modifier Cap (Dex Cap)**: This number is the maximum amount of your Dexterity modifier that can apply to your AC while you are wearing a given suit of armor. For example, if you have a Dexterity modifier of +4 and you are wearing a suit of half plate, you apply only a +1 bonus from your Dexterity modifier to your AC while wearing that armor.

**Check Penalty**: While wearing your armor, you take this penalty to Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks, except for those that have the attack trait. If you meet the armor's Strength threshold (see Strength below), you don't take this penalty.

**Speed Penalty**: While wearing a suit of armor, you take the penalty listed in this entry to your Speed, as well as to any other movement types you have, such as a climb Speed or swim Speed, to a minimum Speed of 5 feet. If you meet the armor's Strength threshold (see below), you reduce the penalty by 5 feet.

**Strength**: This entry indicates the Strength score at which you are strong enough to overcome some of the armor's penalties. If your Strength is equal to or greater than this value, you no longer take the armor's check penalty, and you decrease the Speed penalty by 5 feet (to no penalty if the penalty was –5 feet, or to a –5-foot penalty if the penalty was –10 feet).

**Bulk**: This entry gives the armor's Bulk, assuming you're wearing the armor and distributing its weight across your body. A suit of armor that's carried or worn usually has 1 more Bulk than what's listed here (or 1 Bulk total for armor of light Bulk). An armor's Bulk is increased or decreased if it's sized for creatures that aren't Small or Medium in size, following the rules on page 295.

**Group**: Each type of medium and heavy armor belongs to an armor group, which classifies it with similar types of armor. Some abilities reference armor groups, typically to grant armor specialization effects, which are described further below.

### Armor Traits

The traits you commonly find for armor are the following:

-   **Bulwark**: The armor covers you so completely that it provides benefits against some damaging effects. On Reflex saves to avoid a damaging effect, such as a fireball, you add a +3 modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.
-   **Comfort**: The armor is so comfortable that you can rest normally while wearing it.
-   **Flexible**: The armor is flexible enough that it doesn't hinder most actions. You don't apply its check penalty to Acrobatics or Athletics checks.
-   **Noisy**: This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence when you're using the Avoid Notice exploration activity.

### Armor specialization Effects

Certain class features can grant you additional benefits with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and heavy armors have armor specialization effects.

**Chain**: The armor is so flexible it can bend with a critical hit and absorb some of the blow. Reduce the damage from critical hits by either 4 + the value of the armor's potency rune for medium armor, or 6 + the value of the armor's potency rune for heavy armor. This can't reduce the damage to less than the damage rolled for the hit before doubling for a critical hit.

**Composite**: The numerous overlapping pieces of this armor protect you from piercing attacks. You gain resistance to piercing damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor's potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor's potency rune for heavy armor.

**Leather**: The thick second skin of the armor disperses blunt force to reduce bludgeoning damage. You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor's potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor's potency rune for heavy armor.

**Plate**: The sturdy plate provides no purchase for a cutting edge. You gain resistance to slashing damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor's potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor's potency rune for heavy armor.
