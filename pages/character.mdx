Be sure to have a character sheet and a place to write down notes before starting. The GM will have a digital character sheet to help manage all the decisions you make during character creation.

Creating a character is a matter of ABCDE: Ancestry; Background; Culture; Devotion; and Extraneous. While you are making these choices, be sure to note the ability boosts and ability flaws you gain. These will be important during step 5.

But before you begin making choices, consider what sort of character you want to play. Keep in mind your character wants to be an adventurer, it is up to you who they are while they adventure and why they do it.

The game will be taking place in Eberron, a pre-made campaign setting designed in the mid-2000s. There are many online forums and videos discussing the lore. You are encouraged to go as deep or as shallow as you like, and talk with the GM for character ideas if you are having trouble.

During session 0, you will be asked the following questions so the GM can get an idea of how your character fits into the world and the story. For information on the Last War, see the [Eberron Introduction](/eberron) page.

1. Where are you from?
2. How did the Last War affect you? Did you fight in it, were you a witness to any major events?
3. What have you been doing since the end of the Last War?
4. What group do you have the strongest connection with? If not a group, then what person?

# Step 1: Choose an Ancestry

Choose an ancestry and a related heritage. Ancestry determines your character's Size and Speed, and contributes to their Hit Points and abilities. You gain all ancestry features listed and one ancestry feat of your choice.

# Step 2: Choose a Background

Your character's background might represent their upbringing, an aptitude they've been honing since their youth, or another aspect of their life before they became an adventurer. You gain training in a skill, training in a Lore, a skill feat, and an ability boost.

# Step 3: Choose a Culture

Your character's culture is about your strongest connection, be it national identity or cultural heritage. Unlike background, culture does not have a predetermined list and is more freeform. You gain training in a Lore related to your culture and a recommended language you likely know.

# Step 4: Choose a Devotion

What inspires you to be an adventurer. The call to adventure was not passed on, you are in this life for a reason. Like culture, devotion is freeform but provides no mechanical changes.

# Step 5: Choose extraneous options

The last step is to choose your Class, assign ability scores, and choose languages. Class is the biggest mechanical choice for your character.

Until level 3, you can change your class if you are unsatisfied, just let the GM know before hand. After level 3, you can change classes, but it will have to happen within the fiction of the story.
