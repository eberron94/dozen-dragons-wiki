You can use lay on hands to damage evil creatures as if it were undead; in this case, lay on hands deals good damage instead of positive damage and gains the good trait. This good damage can affect non-evil creatures that fall within the Hierarchy of Evil. This doesn't prevent you from healing such a creature with lay on hands; you choose whether to heal or harm."
