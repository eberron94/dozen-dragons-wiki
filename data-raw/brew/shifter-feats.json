This change is not similar to the change of a were-creature. While in hybrid-form, you gain the beast trait and a feature of the beast within your heritage. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes, or until you spend an action, with the concentrate trait, to dismiss it. In addition, you gain a claws unarmed Strike resembling the features of your beast within (claws for felines, talons for eagles, and so on). Your claws deal 1d4 piercing damage, have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits, and are in the brawling weapon group."
