A background gives you training with a skill, training with a Lore, two ability boosts, and a skill feat. The following options have not been converted to Eberron lore, as such many of them have flavor text referencing a different world. You are free to take them as the name and mechanics alone. Alternatively, you can substitute your own idea for what the background entails; work with the GM to find an Eberron specific alternative for the flavor text.
